Today I pretty much **_completed_** the `revamp` of this **_website_**. My
**_previous build_** had been with `GatsbyJS`, but **_from_** the
**_beginning_**, I **_seemed_** to constantly **_encounter_** `issues` with it. I had **_chosen_** it as a `static framework` because of the
`image optimization` it **_provided_**. I **_also_** was **_interested_** in
`GraphQL` at the time (still am, but **_more_** on the `backend`), so **_that_** is **_why_** I **_went_** with it.

But **_these days_**, there are **_more options_** to **_choose from_**, and
which have **_more features_** to **_offer_** out of the box.

I had **_heard_** about `Next.js` for a while, and what **_attracted me_** to it the **_most_** was its `server side rendering` and the **_ability_** to **_tack on_** a `backend`. But **_what_** does `server side rendering` **_mean_**?

**_According_** to [Educative](https://www.educative.io/answers/what-is-server-side-rendering),

> Server-side rendering (SSR), is the ability of an application to contribute by displaying the web-page on the server instead of rendering it in the browser. Server-side sends a fully rendered page to the client; the clientâ€™s JavaScript bundle takes over and allows the SPA framework to operate. There is also client-side rendering which slows down the procedure of viewing and interacting with the web page. &mdash; ***Educative.io***

But **_why_** is this **_such_** a **_big deal_**, you **_may ask_**.

There are **_great advantages_** to using `SSR`.

-   Pages **_load faster_**, which means **_better_** `UX`.

-   It **_greatly contributes_** to `Search Engine Optimization` (`SEO`), and
    **_correctly_** indexes pages. `Google` **_favors_** web pages with
    **_faster_** `load time`.

-   It **_contributes_** to the `loading` of a `user`'s **_page_** when they
    have a **_slow_** `internet connection`.

`GatsbyJS` **_also_** has `server side rendering`, but **_not_** in the **_same
way_** as `Next.JS`. It is **_still_** a **_purel_**y `static`,
`frontend framework`. AND `build time` was **_never_** `blazing fast`!

With `Next.js`, there is **_also_** the **_ability_** to **_use_**
`environment variables`, which would be **_typically used_** in an `application` with a `backend`. **_Well_**, we **_CAN_** add a `backend` to our `Next.js` **_applications_**! But we **_can also_** use them in our `Next.js` **_static sites_** by **_adding_** the `NEXT_PUBLIC` **_prefix_**.

And **_why_** is the **_ability_** to use `environment variables` **_so huge_**? It means that we can **_hide_** our **_little sensitive secrets_** from the `browser`. With **_purely_** `static`, `frontend` **_applications_**, we **_cannot_** do that, thereby **_exposing_** our **_sensitive data_** to the world within our pages' **_parsed_** `HTML` **_markup_**.

That's **_great_**, you **_may say_**. But **_what_** is the **_big deal_**
about **_being able_** to **_use_** `dotenv` with `Next.js`? Doesn't `Next.js` **_already have_** its **_own way_** of **_dealing_** with
`environment variables`?

**YES**. It **_does_**. **_However_**, the **_process_** is a bit `"circular"`, and **_not_** as **_simple_** to **_implement_**. Honestly, I **_did not_** even **_try_** to **_learn it_** after **_reading_** about it in **_several places_**. I thought there **_had_** to be an **_easier way_**. And since I **_have used_** `dotenv` since **_learning_** about it some **_years_** ago, I thought there **_had_** to be a **_way_** of **_using_** it in `Next.js`. And there **_sure_** is. **_Above all_**, it is **_SO EASY_** to **_implement_**. **_Why_** would I **_want_** to **_configure_** my `environment variables` in
**_ANY OTHER WAY_**?

How did I **_find out_** about it? I **_came across_** an **_article_** on
`Medium` entitled [Environmental Variables in Next.js with dotenv](https://medium.com/courtly-intrepid/environmental-variables-in-next-js-with-dotenv-599c5bbfdf74), by `Deepak Surya`, which **_provided_** the **_answer_** to my `question`:
"`How can I use dotenv with Next.js?`"

I did make a **_slight modification_** to the `code` Deepak Surya
**_presented_** in the `article`, **_making_** the `process` **_even easier_**.

The **_first_** `environment variables` I **_added_** were for my `ConvertKit` **newsletter form** inside the [Next.js Tailwindcss starter blog](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog)
I use(d) to **_build_** this `site`. And the **_process_** was the
**_following_**:

**_First_**, I **_had_** to **_specifiy_** `convertkit` **_inside_** my
`siteMetadata.js` file:

```javascript
//data/siteMetadata.js
newsletter: {
  // supports mailchimp, buttondown, convertkit, klaviyo, revue, emailoctopus
  // Please add your .env file and modify it according to your selection
  provider: 'convertkit',
},
```

**_Next_**, I **_added_** the `NEXT_PUBLIC` **_prefix_** to the `ConvertKit`
**_related variables_** I was **_using_** in `convertkit.js`:

```javascript
//api/convertkit.js
const FORM_ID = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVERTKIT_FORM_ID
const API_KEY = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVERTKIT_API_KEY
const API_URL = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVERTKIT_API_URL
```

which **_initially_** was:

```javascript
const FORM_ID = process.env.CONVERTKIT_FORM_ID
const API_KEY = process.env.CONVERTKIT_API_KEY
const API_URL = process.env.CONVERTKIT_API_URL
```

I **_added_** the `NEXT_PUBLIC` **_prefix_** to **_make_** the
`environment variables` **_accessible_** to the `browser`.

But **_none_** of this **_meant anything_** until I **_installed_** the `dotenv` **npm package** in my `Next.js` **_application_** from **_inside_** the **_root_** of the `application`. I **_installed_** it using the **_following_** `npm command`:

```javascript
npm i dotenv -S
```

Then I had to **_actually use_** this package **_somewhere_**. It is always used in the `backend` and **_therefore_** is `required` **_instead_** of `imported` **_into_** a **_file_**. So that meant **_requiring_** it **_inside_** the `next.config.js` **_file_** where the `require` **_keyword_** can be **_used_**. It is **_not_** a `JavaScript` **_keyword_**, but a `Node.js` **_keyword_**. It is a **_built-in_** `Node.js` **_function_** whith the **_sole purpose_** of
**_loading modules_** such as `dotenv`! So **_right above_** my `module.exports` in `Next.js`, which is **_also used_** in `Node.js` **_instead_** of `JavaScript`'s `export default` or `export const`, for **_example_**, I
**_added_** the **_following_**:

```javascript
const webpack = require('webpack')

const dotenv = require('dotenv')

dotenv.config()
```

It is essential to require webpack, as done above. Otherwise, an error will be thrown. Something like the following:

```shell
npm run dev

> next dev

```

It is **_necessary_** to **_make sure_** it is **_explicitly required_** in the **_file_**, because `process.env` is **_not available_** in `browsers`, but as **_already mentioned_**, `Next.js` **_both runs_** in the `server` as **_well as_** the `browser`.

Then I **_had_** to require `dotenv`. **_THEN_**, **_instead_** of **_what_** Deepak **_states_**, **_all_** we **_have_** to **_do_** is **_add_** `dotenv.config()`. I would **_do_** the **_same_** if **_working solely_** in a `Node.js` **_application_**, and was **_not_** `requiring dotenv` in a `file` **_located_** in the **_root_** of the **_application_**, but **_inside_** another **_subfolder_**. That is **_all_** you have to **_do_** to make it work **_anywhere_**. And **_since_** I had **_placed_** my `.env` file in my **_application_**'s `root folder`, I **_did not_** have to **_set_** the `path` to my `.env` file. In **_fact_**, when **_working_** with `dotenv`, you **_always_** have to **_place_** the `.env` file **_inside_** the `root folder`
of your **_application_**.

**_Next_**, inside my `module.exports`, I had to **_add_** the **_following_**:

```javascript
//next.config.js
config.plugins.push(
	new webpack.EnvironmentPlugin(
		'NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVERTKIT_API_URL',
		'NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVERTKIT_API_KEY',
		'NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVERTKIT_FORM_ID',
	),
)
```

I **_already_** was **_using_** `webpac`k inside `next.config.js`, so I did
**_not need_** to **_include_** `webpack(config) {}`. `webpack` was **_already there_**. So I **_placed_** the **_above code_** right before the
`return config` **_statement_**, which was **_also_** already there. I also
**_included_** `environment variables` for `Giscus Github comments`, and
`Google Analytics`. The **_process_** is the **_same_**. And **_that_** is
**_it_**!

As `Deepak` **_mentions_** in her **_article_**, the `webpack.EnvironmentPlugin()` "parses" the `destructured object` she
**_includes_** in her `code`. **_However_**, that is **_not_** a **_good
demonstration_** of what **_actually_** should be **_done_**. The **_above_** is the **_correct approach_**. Please **_refer_** to the `webpack documentation` **_regarding_** the `webpack.EnvironmentPlugin()`:

- [(webpack) EnvironmentPlugin](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/environment-plugin/).

And **_THAT_** is **_IT_**!

As I **_mention_** in my `Tweet` on `July 4, 2022`,

> @nextjs is a good reason why one ever again should be revealing sensitive data on client side. No excuse. And I am seeing it out there when using Nextjs. No no no! &mdash; [Maria D. Campbell (@letsbsocial1) - July 4, 2022](https://twitter.com/letsbsocial1/status/1544153765305061378)

Happy `dotenving`!
