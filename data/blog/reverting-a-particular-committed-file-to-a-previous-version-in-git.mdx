I **_just made_** some **_changes_** to a `file` and then **_committed them_** so I **_could have_** a **_reference_** of those **_changes_** in my `Git` **_history_**, but I **_knew_** that I **_wanted_** to **_revert back_** to the **_prior version_** of the `file`.

I **_knew_** that I **_needed_** the `object id` of the `file` from the **_last commit_** I had **_made_**, but **_how_** was I to **_get_** it?

It was **_really simple_**. The **_following_** is the **_command_** I
**_ran_**:

```shell
git rev-parse where-to-put-our-logic:src/components/Shop/ProductItem.js
```

And the `command` **_returned_** the **_following_**:

```shell
243d68e5d39018d368391ffdff9ea886484e13da
```

which was the `hash` for that **_particular_** `file` in the `commit` I had
**_previously made_** in the `where-to-put-our-logic` **_branch_**.

`git rev-parse` is the `command`. `where-to-put-our-logic` is the **_name_** of the `branch`, and **_where_** I **_made_** the `commit`.
`src/components/Shop/ProductItem.js` is the **_relative path_** to the `file` I **_needed_** the `object id` of.

**_However_**, I **_wanted_** to **_get_** the **_latest_** `id` of the `file` in the `master` **_branch_**, which is **_where_** I **_merged_** the **_latest commits_** into. So I **_needed_** to **_get_** the `hash` of the **_latest_** `commit` which **_contained_** the **_version_** of the `file` I **_wanted_**.

**_First_** I **_ran_** the `git log --oneline` command. This **_logs_** a
**_list_** of **_all_** the `commits` made in the `local repository`.

`git log` **_shows_** a `list` of **_all_** the `commits` **_made_** to a
`repository`. **_There_**, we can **_see_** the `hash` of **_each_** `Git`
**_commit_**, the `message` **_associated_** with **_each_** `commit` (one
**_reason_** why **_good_** `commit` **_messages_** are **_important_**, to
**_remind us_** what we **_did_** with the `code`, for **_example_**, in
**_that_** `commit`), and **_more_** `metadata`. This `command` is **_useful_** for **_displaying_** the `history` of a `repository`.

**_Below_** is the `--oneline` I was **_looking_** for in the `results`
**_returned_** from **_running_** the `git log â€”online` command:

```shell
e5f52f0 (origin/main, main) Merge branch 'refresher-practice-2'
```

The `message` here **_refers_** to the **_fact_** that I had **_merged_** the `refreshed-practice-2` **_branch_** into the `main` **_branch_**, so **_even though_** it was a **_default message_**, it **_still_** was **_informative_**, and the `commit hash` I **_wanted_**. Then, **_in order_** to **_revert_** the **_content_** of the `file` to **_that_** `commit`, I **_ran_** the **_following_** `command`:

```shell
git reset e5f52f0 src/components/Shop/ProductItem.js
```

And the **_following_** was **_returned_** in the `Terminal console`:

```shell
Unstaged changes after reset:
M       src/components/Shop/ProductItem.js
```

Then I **_ran_** `git status` to **_see_** what the **_status_** was of that
`file`:

```shell
git status
```

And I **_got back_** the **_following_** in the `Terminal console`:

```shell
git status
On branch where-to-put-our-logic
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
        modified:   src/components/Shop/ProductItem.js

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   src/components/Shop/ProductItem.js
```

Then I **_ran_** the **_following_** `command`:

```shell
git checkout src/components/Shop/ProductItem.js
```

And **_got_** the **_following_** back in the `Terminal console`:

```shell
Updated 1 path from the index
```

Then **_again_**, I **_ran_** `git status`, and **_got back_** the
**_following_** in the `Terminal console`:

```shell
git status
On branch where-to-put-our-logic
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
        modified:   src/components/Shop/ProductItem.js
```

So I **_staged_** the **_reverted changes_** of the `file`. I was **_not sure_** whether I **_wanted_** to **_do that_** or **_not_**, but I **_ran_** the **_following_** `command`:

```shell
git restore --staged src/components/Shop/ProductItem.js
```

As **_prompted_** by the `information` **_returned_** to the `Terminal console` when I **_ran_** `git status` (right above). Then I **_ran_** `git status` **_again_**, and **_got_** the **_following_** back:

```shell
On branch where-to-put-our-logic
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   src/components/Shop/ProductItem.js

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

Since the **_content_** of the `file` was the **_same_** when I had **_staged_** the **_reverted changes_** and **_now_**, when I had **_unstaged_** those **_changes_**, but they were **_still present_**, I **_could have_** just **_skipped_**

```shell
git restore --staged src/components/Shop/ProductItem.js
```

and just **_committed_** the **_changes_**. But **_since_** I had **_unstaged_** the **_reverted changes_**, I **_had_** to **_do_** the **_following_**:

```shell
git add src/components/Shop/ProductItem.js
```

And **_then_**:

```shell
git commit
```

And the **_following_** was **_returned_** to the `Terminal console` **_after_** I **_created_** my `commit message` in `VIM` and was **_taken back_** to my `where-to-put-our-logic` **_branch_**:

```shell
git commit
[where-to-put-our-logic aa33ca2] Add back original code
 1 file changed, 13 insertions(+), 49 deletions(-)
```

`[where-to-put-our-logic aa33ca2]` **_refers_** to the `branch` I am on
**_followed_** by the `hash` of the **_new_** `commit` I just **_made_**. And `Add back original code` is the `commit message` I **_created_** in `VIM`.

`1 file changed, 13 insertions(+), 49 deletions(-)` just **_lets_** me
**_know_** that `1 file` was **_changed_**, `13` **_additions_** and `49`
**_deletions made_** to the `file`.

I had a **_second_** `file` in the **_same project_** that I **_wanted_** to
**_revert back_** to the `version` in the **_same_** (**_previous_**) `commit`, so I **_followed_** the **_steps_** I **_made_** the **_first_** `time around`.

I **_wanted_** to **_revert back_** to the **_previous version_** of a `file` with the **_relative path_** `src/store/cart-slice.js`, so I **_first ran_** the **_following_** `command` in `Terminal` **_inside_** the **_root_** of the `project`:

```shell
git reset e5f52f0 src/store/cart-slice.js
```

And when I **_hit_** `return`, I **_got_** the **_following_** back in the
`Terminal console`:

```shell
Unstaged changes after reset:
M       src/store/cart-slice.js
```

Then I **_ran_** `git status`, and the **_following_** was **_returned_** in the `Terminal console`:

```shell
git status
On branch where-to-put-our-logic
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
        modified:   src/store/cart-slice.js

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   src/store/cart-slice.js
```

And when I **_checked_** at **_this point_** to **_see_** if the `file`
**_content_** had **_changed_** yet, it **_had not_**. So then I **_knew_** I **_had_** to **_go through_** all the **_steps_** I **_had taken_** with the **_previous_** `file`.

So **_next_**, **_as before_**, I **_ran_**

```shell
git checkout src/store/cart-slice.js
```

And it is with **_this_** `command` that the **_content_** of the `file`
**_reverted back_** to the **_version_** in the `commit` with the `hash` of
`e5f52f0`. So **_what_** is **_happening_** here, is I **_removed_** all the
`pre-commit` **_changes_** that had been **_made_** to the `file`, **_after_** I had **_reset_** it to the `commit` I **_wanted_**. And the **_following_** was **_returned_** to the `Terminal console`:

```shell
git status
On branch where-to-put-our-logic
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
        modified:   src/store/cart-slice.js
```

So **_checking out_** the `file` **_staged_** it, and with the **_version_** of the `code` that I **_wanted_**. So **_then_** I **_ran_** the **_following_** `command` in `Terminal`:

```shell
git commit
```

And I was **_taken_** into `VIM` to **_write_** my `commit message`. And when I **_returned_** to the `where-to-put-our-logic` **_branch_**, and **_ran_** `git status`, I **_got back_** the **_following_**:

```shell
On branch where-to-put-our-logic
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

Which is **_exactly_** what I **_wanted_**! I **_found_** that I did **_not_** have to **_run_** the `git restore` **command**. That was **_overkill_**.

I **_also wrote_** a `post` **_entitled_** [Removing unstaged changes to your individual files in Git](https://www.interglobalmedianetwork.com/blog/removing-unstaged-changes-to-your-individual-files-in-git),
which you **_might want_** to **_check out_** as well.

**_Happy_** `Git` **_version control_**!
