## Projects vs apps in Django

`Projects` and `apps` are `equally` important `concepts` in `Django`, but they
`serve` different `purposes`.

A `Django` project `contains` a `high` level `directory` and a `sub-directory`
by the `same name`, and the `high` level `directory` contains `one` or `more`
Django `apps`, `settings`, and `configurations` for those `apps`. It `contains`
all the `files` and `directories` needed for the (`high-level`) Django `project`
to `run`. It's also `where` we `define` database `settings`, `URL routing`, and
other `global configurations` for the `apps` it `contains`.

A `Django` app `is` a self-contained `module` that `can` be `plugged` into any
`Django` project. A `Django` app `serves` a `specific purpose` or `feature` in a
`Django` project, and `includes`, `models`, `views`, `templates`, and `static`
files.

However, we `can’t run` a `Django` app `without` a `project`.

`One example` of a `Django` app is a `web blog`, which can be `all inclusive`
inside a `Django` app.

## Creating an app in the Django project (django_boards)

The `next step` in the `creation` of a `Django` (`web`) `application` is to
`create` a `Django` app `inside` the `Django` project. I will be `creating` an
`app` called `boards`.

`In order` to `create` my `app`, I `have` to `go` into the `directory` that
`contains` the `manage.py` file. `In` my `case`, that is the `top level`
django_boards `project` directory. For a `project` structure `refresher`, please
visit
[How to create a fullstack application using Django and Python Part 2](http://localhost:3000/blog/how-to-create-a-fullstack-application-using-django-and-python-part-2).

`Next`, I `run` the `following command` in `Terminal`:

```shell
django-admin startapp boards
```

This `results` in the `following additions` to the `top-level` django_boards
`directory`:

```shell
/django-boards # high level Django application folder for Django project(s) and app(s)
  - /django_boards # root folder of the django_boards project
    - /boards # app folder
      - __init__.py # file
      - admin.py # file
      - apps.py # file
      - /migrations # folder
        - __init__.py # file
      - models.py # file
      - tests.py # file
      - views.py # file
    - /django_boards # folder of the django_boards project/package
      - __init__.py # file
      - asgi.py # file
      - settings.py # file
      - urls.py # file
      - wsgi.py # file
    - manage.py # file
  - /venv # folder
```

### Django migrations (migrations directory)

The `migrations directory` is `where` the `migration` files for the `boards` app
`reside`. They should be `committed` to, and `distributed` as `part` of the
`codebase`.

The `files` inside the `migrations` directory `keep track` of the `changes` made
in the `models.py` file in the `Django` app, `where` the `models` themselves
reside. This `keeps` the `database` and `models` in `sync`.

`Migrations` pass on `changes` I `make` to my `models`, `such` as `adding` a
`field`, `deleting` a `model`, etc., `into` my `database schema` **[^1]**.

`When` the `Django` application `runs`, `Django` translates the `Python` models
into `database schemas`, `mapping` each `model` to a `corresponding` database
`table` and `each field` to a `corresponding column` in the `table`.

`Even though` the `migration process` is `automated`, we `need` to `know` when
to `make` migrations, `when` to `run` them, and the `issues` we might `face`.

### ⎼⎼init⎼⎼.py

`Just` as `with` the `⎼⎼init⎼⎼.py` file in the `django_boards` project,
`⎼⎼init⎼⎼.py` in the `boards` app is a `special file` used to `initialize` the
`boards'` app's `namespaces` **[^3]**. It is `executed` when a `package` is
`imported`. `Without` this `file`, `Python` won’t `recognize` a `directory` as a
`package`.

`⎼⎼init⎼⎼.py` recognizes a `directory` as a `Python` package so the `Python`
interpreter can `detect` the `modules` inside.

`⎼⎼init⎼⎼.py` can contain `initialization code` for the `package`, `such` as
`importing` submodules, `defining` variables, or `executing` other `code`.

### The Django admin site (admin.py)

The `Django` admin `site` is an `"automatic"` admin `interface` which reads
`metadata` from our `models` to `provide` a model-centric `interface` where
`trusted users` can manage `content` on the `site`. It's `recommended` to `use`
it as an `internal` management `tool` and `not` for `building` a `site`'s
`front end`.

The `admin.py` file is `where` the
[ModelAdmin class](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/ref/contrib/admin/)
`resides`. It is `also where` we `register` our `models` which we `create` in
`models.py`.

### apps.py

The `apps.py` file is `located` in the `boards` app, and it is the
`configuration` file for the `django_boards` project's `boards` app. This is
`where` the `BoardsConfig` class is `located` and `which` is `used` in
`INSTALLED_APPS` setting in `settings.py`. See
[Configuring the boards app in the django_boards project (settings.py)](#configuring-the-boards-app-in-the-django-boards-project-settingspy)
`for` more `information`.

### models.py

`models.py` defines the `structure` of a `Django` app's `database`. `In` this
`case`, `it is` the `boards` app.

### tests.py

The `tests.py` file is `where` we `create` automated `tests` for the `Django`
app. The `Django` testing `system` automatically `detects` tests in any `file`
whose `name` begins with `"test"`.

### views.py

The `views.py` file `contains` the `views` of a `Django` app. `Django` views are
`functions` that take `http requests` and return `http responses`. `Each` view
`performs` a `different task`.

## Configuring the boards app in the django_boards project (settings.py)

`In order` to `configure` the `django_boards` project to `use` the `newly`
created `boards` app, I `have` to `add` a `reference` to its `configuration`
class, `located` in the `boards` app's `apps.py` file, in the `INSTALLED_APPS`
setting in `settings.py`. `After` I `add` it to the I`NSTALLED_APPS` setting, it
`should` look `like` the `following`:

```shell
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    'boards.apps.BoardsConfig', # boards app configuration
]
```

## Writing the first boards app view (views.py)

`Now` that I `have` a [views.py](#viewspy) `file` for my `boards` app `views`, I
`create` my first `view` inside:

```shell
from django.http import HttpResponse

def index(request):
    return HttpResponse('Hello, World!')
```

I `created` a simple `function` called `index`, which `refers` to the
`Django Boards` application `home page`, `sends` an `Http` request for the
`index` page, and `receives` an `HttpResponse` with the `text` string
`'Hello, World!'`. `As` mentioned `earlier`, `Django` views are `Python`
functions which `receive` an `HttpRequest` object (`request`) and `return` an
`HttpResponse` object.

## Telling the Django project (django_boards) when to serve the view (urls.py)

The `django_boards` project `urls.py` file `contains` the `URL declarations` for
the `django_boards` project. It `represents` a `table` of `contents` of the
`Django` site.

`Initially` I `added` the `following` to `urls.py` located `inside` the
`django_boards` project:

```python
"""
URL configuration for django_boards project.

The `urlpatterns` list routes URLs to views. For more information please see:
    https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/topics/http/urls/
Examples:
Function views
    1. Add an import:  from my_app import views
    2. Add a URL to urlpatterns:  path('', views.home, name='home')
Class-based views
    1. Add an import:  from other_app.views import Home
    2. Add a URL to urlpatterns:  path('', Home.as_view(), name='home')
Including another URLconf
    1. Import the include() function: from django.urls import include, path
    2. Add a URL to urlpatterns:  path('blog/', include('blog.urls'))
"""
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path

from boards import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.index, name='index'),
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
]
```

The `comment` (in `green`) was `already present` in `urls.py`. It `tells` me
`how` to `use` the `urls.py` file. `Same` with
`from django.contrib import admin`, `from django.urls import path`, and:

```python
urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
]
```

In `older versions` of `Django`, you `might` see `re_path` imported `and` used
`instead`:

```python
from django.urls import path, re_path

urlpatterns = [
    re_path(r'^$', views.index, name='index'),
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
]
```

`re_path` stands for `regular` expression `path`. `However`, `this` is the
[old way of handling urls](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55285814/when-should-i-use-path-over-re-path),
and it's `NOT` recommended to `use` it. The `path` module `should` be `used`
instead. It `makes` things `simpler` and `more readable`.

```python
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path

from boards import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.index, name='index'),
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
]
```

### Breaking down the (new) code in urls.py

`First`, I `had` to `import` the `views.py` file `from` the `boards` app:

```python
from boards import views
```

`Then` I `had` to add `path('', views.index, name='index'),` to the `top` of the
`urlpatterns` array:

```python
urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.index, name='index'),
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
]
```

The `empty string` (`''`) `passed` to `path` represents the `path` to the `home`
or `index` page (`'/'`). `This` path `url` is `used` to `call` the `index`
function from `views.py`. It `also means` that I `am able` to `see` the `index`
view `when` using `either` the `http://localhost:8000` or the
`http://localhost:8000/` url. `Both urls` will `match` the `index` view.

`views.index` represents the `index` function in `views.py`.

The `name attribute` and its `value` is `referred` to as `url pattern naming`.
[Naming url patterns](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/topics/http/urls/#naming-url-patterns)
in `Django` is `required` if we `want` to perform `URL reversing` **[^4]**. `I`
am `not` doing `it` for `that reason` here. `However`, it `helps` better
`identify` the `purpose` of the `url`.

When `naming` url `patterns`, it is `very important` to choose `names` that
`will` not `clash` with `other names` in the `global namespace`. `For example`,
if I` name` a `url` pattern `"index"`, and `another app` uses the `same name`,
the `url` that the `reverse()` method `finds` depends on `whichever pattern` is
`last` in the `project`'s `url` patterns `list`. `Putting` a `prefix` on our
`URL` names, `perhaps taken` from the `app name`, like `boards-index` instead of
`index`, for example, `decreases` the `chances` of `name collision`.

## Running the development server to view the results of the changes made to views.py and urls.py

`Now`, `when` I `run` the `python3 manage.py runserver` command, `and` then
`add` the `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` url to the `address bar` in the `browser`,
the `following appears`:

```shell
Hello, World!
```

This `means` I `have` successfully `created` my `first view`!

## Footnotes

**[^1]**: A database schema refers to the logical and visual configuration of an
entire relational database **[^2]**. The database objects are often grouped and
displayed as tables, functions, and relations. A schema describes the
organization and storage of data in a database and defines the relationship
between various tables. -- **_from_**
[Database Schema Definition](https://www.solarwinds.com/resources/it-glossary/database-schema),
**_Solar Winds_**

**[^2]**: A relational database (RDB) is a collection of information that
organizes data in predefined relationships where data is stored in one or more
tables (or "relations") of columns and rows, making it easy to see and
understand how different data structures relate to each other. -- **_from_**
[What is a relational database?](https://cloud.google.com/learn/what-is-a-relational-database#),
**_Google Cloud_**

**[^3]**: In general, a namespace is the name of a directory. So the
"namespaces" referred to here are the directories located within the Django
boards app.
