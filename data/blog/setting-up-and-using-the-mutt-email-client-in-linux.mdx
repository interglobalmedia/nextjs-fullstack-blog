## What is mutt?

`mutt` is a `powerful` Command Line `email client` that `sends` and `receives`
emails via `Terminal`. I `use` it `in addition` to `mailx`, because unlike
`mailx`, it is `able` to `send` real `email attachments` as `well` as `save`
those `attachments` on a `user`'s `local machine`.

`mutt` supports `MIME`, `GPG`, `PGP`, and `threading`, making it a
`powerful tool` for `managing emails` directly from the `Linux` Command Line.
`mutt` also allows `system administrators` to `automate` and `streamline` their
`workflows` with `automated notifications`. `Email` plays a `critical role` in
`system security` and can be `used` to deliver `security alerts`, `confirm` user
`actions`, and even `recover` lost `passwords`. By `properly` managing `emails`
using `mutt`, we can `enhance` the `security` of our `Linux` system.

There are `many` other `uses` for `mutt`. To `learn more`, please `visit` the
`article` entitled
[Mastering Mutt: How to Install Mutt Command in Linux](https://ioflood.com/blog/install-mutt-command-linux/).

## Installing mutt

**One thing to note**: `in` whichever `directory` we initialize `mutt` is the
`default directory` where `email attachments` are `saved`.

`mutt` is not `native` to `Linux`. We `have` to `install` it. I `am` on the
`Ubuntu` derivative `Linux Mint`, `so` I can `install` it `with` the
`following command`(`s`):

```shell
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install mutt
```

`Since` I only `want` to `use` it `locally` because I have `Linux Mint`
installed with `VirtualBox` and `only have` so much `virtual` (and `hard`)
`disk space` to `work with`, I `decided` to `pass up` on `using` an `external`
(`gmail`) `email address` to `send` and `receive` emails. My `main reason` for
`wanting` to use `mutt` was `because` of its `ability` to send
`email attachments` and save `received attachments` locally. `There are` many
other `powerful features` available, but `this` is the `feature` that `grabbed`
my `attention`.

## Sending an email locally to another user which contains an attachment

I `want` to `send` a `file` to `another user` on the `local network` in `Linux`
using `mutt`. I `would` take the `following steps`:

1. First, I would `cd` into the `directory` where I `first` initialized `mutt`.
   `In` my `case`, it was my `home directory`, `/home/maria`.
2. Next, I would `determine` which email `attachment` I `want` to `send` to the
   `other user`.

Next, I will `send` a `text` file called `email_attachment.txt` to local user
`magdala`, which `contains` the text
`This is some dummy text for the mutt email attachment demo I am creating for my post entitled "Setting up and using the mutt email client in Linux."`
I run the following command in Terminal:

```shell
mutt -s "Sending Magdala the email_attachment.txt" -a email_attachment.txt -- magdala@maria-VirtualBox
```

This `opens up` the `mutt` interface in the nano text editor. it looks
`something like` the `following`:

`Then` I `hit` the `Return` key, and `something like` the following `appears`:

![Screenshot of the email subject line](Screenshot-from-2024-08-14-18-24-13.png)

`Next`, I hit `Return` and the `following appears`:

![Screenshot of the body of the email](Screenshot-from-2024-08-14-18-25-28.png)

_Screenshot of the body of the email_

The `next part` is `very important` to follow `correctly`. `After` I have
`completed` the `body` of my `email`, I hit `Control` + `O` (`not zero`) key and
then the `Return` key, and `then` the `following appears`:

_Screenshot of sending an email to user magdala_

`As shown` at the `top` of the `window`, I `hit` the `y` key to actually `send`
the `email` to `user magdala`. `Then`, at the `bottom` of the `window`, "Mail
sent" appears, and `then` I am `taken back` to the `Terminal` command `prompt`.

## Other user receives email and saves email attachment locally

Next, `user` magdala `opens` her `emails` using the `mutt` command, and
`something like` the following `appears`:

![Screenshot of user magdala's email inbox](Screenshot-from-2024-08-14-18-28-33.png)

_Screenshot of user magdala's email inbox_

`Next`, `user` magdala `makes sure` to `select` the `email` which `contains` the
`attachment` she `wants` to `save` to her `local machine` using the `Up` or
`Down` arrow `key`, and `then` she `hits` the `V` key. This `results` in
`something like` the `following`:

![Screenshot of user magdala saving attachment](Screenshot-from-2024-08-14-18-29-18.png)

_Screenshot of user magdala saving attachment_

`Next`, `user` magdala `hits` the `S` key, and `that` is `when` the text
`"Save to file: email_attachment.txt"` appears. And `then` the `following`
appears `after that`:

![Screenshot of attachment saved](Screenshot-from-2024-08-14-18-30-21.png)

_Screenshot of attachment saved_

`Next`, `user` magdala `hits` the `Q` key, and is `taken back` to the `Terminal`
command prompt:

![Screenshot of user magdala being taken back to Terminal command prompt](Screenshot-from-2024-08-14-18-31-28.png)

_Screenshot of user magdala being taken back to Terminal command prompt_

And `as` also `shown` in the `screenshot`, `she` then `runs` the `ls` command to
`make sure` that the `email_attachment.txt` file has been `saved` to her `home`
directory. And it was!

We `have` now `covered` the `basics` of `sending`, `receiving`, and `saving`
email `attachments` using `mutt`.
