**Note 6.24.24**: Most of the information in this post might be outdated. Now, the way that you get your HP Tango X's unique email address is by clicking on the HP Smart app on your smart phone (in my case, iPhone), and then clicking on the printer located at the top of the app, and then go down to "Printer Email Address". When you set up your printer in the HP Smart app, the email address is automatically added to it. Things were much more complicated and more technologically backward when this printer first came out. Just like everything else!

I spent most of my time the past week trying to set up a second wireless HP
printer in my apartment. The process was hell for a variety of reasons.

**_First_** `Mac compatible Printer` I `connected` to `HP Smart`: `HP Tango X`

**_Second_** `Mac compatible Printer` I `connected` to `HP Smart`: `Laser Jet Pro M102w`

**_First_**, there was the documentation, or rather lack thereof. 

**_Second_**, it was **_hard_** to get a `live person` to **_speak with_** in `HP support`. Not that support ended up being the complete help I needed! But at **_least_** I learned all the steps **_by heart_**!

**_Initially_**, it took me forever to `connect` to this **second printer** and **_add it_** to the `HP Smart app` to begin with, which **_replaced_**
`hpconnected.com`. **_Most_** initial `Google searches` **_pointed_** to the
**old website**, which **_no longer exists_**. **_Only after_** a week of
`searching` and **_trying out_** different `search keywords`, did I finally get some **_partially_** `relevant information` I was **_looking_** for. The
**_other_** issue which might have **contributed** to the **_complexity_** of
setting up the **_second printer_** is that it was purchased **_for_** us, and
**not** **_by_** us. The **_first_** printer was purchased by **_me_**.

I thought I would share the information I gathered that resulted in a successful `set-up` of a **_second_** `HP wireless printer`.

**_First_**, you have to **download** the `HP Smart app` to the **_device_** you want to **connect** your **_printer_** to. I already had **_one_**
`HP Smart printer` **_connected_** to my own `iPhone` and `laptop`, and I did
**_not_** want (and could not) to **connect** a **_second_** `wireless printer` to those **_same devices_**. Even if I could, it would mean a **_much slower_** `connection` for **_both_**. As it is, I have **_intermittent_** `wireless congestion` in **_general_**, so a **_second_** `wireless printer` to the **_same network_** would have been a **disaster** for **_me_**. Especially since the printer was **_not meant_** for **my use** in the **_first place_**!

**_After_** you have **downloaded** the app from the
[App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hp-smart/id469284907), make sure that you **_actually_** have **created** an `account` on the
[HP Smart](https://www.hpsmart.com/us/en) `website` **_as well_**. In order for everything to work **_properly_**, **not** **_only_** do you have to `connect` your `printer` to the `HP smart app` on a `mobile device` such as an `iPhone` if you want to **_print_** from a `mobile device` (which you **_should_** want to do, since that is the **_main point_** of `HP Smart` to **_begin with_**), but you have to make sure that the `HP Smart website` **_recognizes_** that **printer** as **_well_**. This step is **_crucial_** to being able to **set up** an `email address` for the `printer` so that you can **_print_** an `attachment` using the printer's **_unique_** `email address` from your **_own_** `email address`. In **_other words_**, you send an `email` to the printer's **_unique_** `email address` with the `file` you want **_printed_** `attached` to the `email`. I will explain this in a bit. It's just **_important_** to **know** **_why_** it is **important** to have an `account` on the `HP Smart website`.

You can **_also_** set up your `wireless printer` for **printing** off of your
`desktop/laptop` computer **_as well_**. However, I will **_not_** be
**covering** that **_aspect_** in this article.

The **_main purpose_** here is to **discuss** creating a `unique email address` using HP's `Web Services` so that **_trusted parties_** (or you yourself) can **send attachments** to your `printer` that are **_subsequently_** printed out there. This is a `great feature` if you are **_not_** in the same **location** as your **_printer_**, but a **_remote_** one, and want to **print** to that **_printer_**, and **read** the **_contents_** at a **later date**. Or perhaps **_send it_** to **someone** who is at the `printer location` so that **_they_** can read it.

In **_my_** case, I am able to easily have **_two_** `wireless printers` which
can function in **_tandem_**, because I have **_two_** `wireless networks`
**_set up_**, and can **dedicate** **_one network_** to one `printer`, and the
**_other network_** to another `printer`.

I only found out after **_much struggle_**, that the **_second_** printer had to be in the **_same room_** as the `network router` in order to be **_able_** to be **set up** and **_work properly_**. I have `internet capability` in **_another room_** where I first set up the **_second_** printer, but it was **_impossible_** to `connect` the **_second_** `wireless printer` properly. Things took **_forever_**, and the printer oftentimes also `lost connection`. **_Most important_** was that I was **_not able_** to `create` a `unique email address` for the **_printer_** from that `location`.

When I **_finally_** figured out **_where_** to **place** the **_second_**
printer, it took **_no time_** to set things up.

It's all about LOCATION. LOCATION. LOCATION.

**_First_** I set things up **_via_** the `HP Smart app` on an **_another_**
`iPhone` which was **connected** to a `wireless network` **_different_** from my `iPhone` and `laptop`. Then I had to **_connect_** to `HP Web Services` by
**typing** in the `unique IP address` of the `printer` in the `web address bar` on the **_associated_** `iPhone`. This **_took me_** to the
`HP Web Services website`.

**_Next_**, I had to make sure that I was in the `HP Web Services` **_tab_**. If **_not_**, I would have had to **_click_** on it to **_get in_**.

Then I had to **_click_** on an `"Enable Web Services"` **button** **_located_** in the `HP Web Services` **tab**, and was then **_given_** the `prompt` that a `printout` of the **printer** `Info Page` was **_being made_**. The page **_contains_** the **printer** `email address`, and the **printer** `claim code`, so that you can **_add_** your `printer` to **_your account_** on the `HP Smart` **website**. It even **_prompts_** you to go to `hpconnected.com` to **_enter_** the **printer** `claim code` within your **_account_**, and thereby be able to **manage** your **_printer_**. **_However_**, when you **type** `hpconnected.com` in the `web browser`, you will be **_re-directed_** to `hpsmart.com`.

**_Enabling_** `HP Web Services` **_results_** in your `printer` being
`web-connected` and having its **_own_** unique `email address`. The
`email address` **_allows you_** to `email` **file attachments** to your
**_printer_** and **print** from **_anywhere_** at any time. IF you **_want_**
to **print articles** off the `internet`, that is **_touch_** and **_go_** with this **set-up** and can **take** a **_long time_**, depending on **_which_** device you `email` **_from_** and how **_far away_** you are **physically** from the **_printer_**.

For **_example_**, when I **sent** an `email` from my **_laptop_** via my
`gmail account`, **containing** an **_attachment_** which I wanted to **_print
out_**, the `printer` **_received_** the `request` almost **_instantaneously_**. However, I **_first_** had to **save** the **_article_** in question on my **desktop** as an `html page` that I **_subsequently_** could **attach** to the **_email_**. This was **_not_** optimal, as it involved a couple of **_extra_** steps, and **only text** was **_printed out_**. The **_only_** other way I could **_possibly_** send the `article` via **_email_**, was by **_copyin_** and **_pasting_** the **contents** of it into the **_body_** of the `email`. And **_who knows_** how it would **print out**! That **_also_** would involve **extra steps** and therefore **_extra time_**.

The **_best way_** to **send articles** for **_others_** to `print out`, is by
**_texting_** the **link** to the `article` via `smart phone`. **_Then_** the
person **receiving** the **_text_** just has to **click** on the **_link_**,
**then** on the `iPhone` **_share icon_**, which **takes them** to **_sharing_** and/or **_printing options_**.

**_Click_** on the `icon` with the `upward arrow`, and it will **_take you_** to **various options**, **_including_** printing with `HP Smart`, **_located_** towards the **bottom** of the `iPhone` **screen**. **_Click on_** `Print with HP Smart`, and it will **_show_** the `individual pages` of the **_selected_** `web article` (or `document`) to be **_printed_**. **_Click_** `Print`, and a `progress bar` will **_appear_**, letting you know **_which_** pages are being **_printed_**, one at a time.

It is **_very_** quick and easy. No fuss. No muss.
