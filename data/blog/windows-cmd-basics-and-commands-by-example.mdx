Lately the **opportunity** arose to **_demonstrate_** how the `Windows` (`10`)
`Command Prompt` (aka `CMD`, **acronym** for `Windows Command Processor`)
**works** and how to **get around** one’s `Windows` computer. `CMD` is a
`command line interface`, and a **way** of **_interacting_** with a `computer`
**_directly_** using `text commands`.

**_Early_** `PC operating systems`, like `MS-DOS`, operated only through
`command-line interfaces`. There was **_no_** `mouse`, `window management`, or
`graphical user interface` (`GUI`) elements like we take for granted today.

`CMD` is also a `shell`. A `shell` **_allows_** the **user** to give `commands` to the `computer`. **_Early versions_** of `Windows` ran `commands` through the `MS-DOS Prompt`, which was the **name** for `Command Prompt` then.

**_Starting_** with `Windows XP`, `Windows` **_broke away_** from `MS-DOS`.
**_However_**, as is even indicated **_here_**, we can **still use** the
`Command Prompt` to **_interface_** with our `computers` **directly** instead of **_clicking_** through various menus. The `Command Prompt` can also run batch files, which are a great way to **_automate tasks_**. We `control` **_both_** our `Windows` and `Mac` computers via the `Command Prompt/Terminal`.

What is **_great_** about **using** the `Command Prompt` (or `Terminal` on a
`Mac`) is that it **_cuts down_** the **steps/time** it **takes** to
**_complete_** a `task`. The `Command Prompt` can **_complete_** a **_task_**
with a **_few_** `key strokes`, whereas it would take **_quite a few_** `clicks` in the `GUI` (`Graphical User Interface`).

If you are the **_only user_** on your `computer`, you probably are the `Admin` (`Administrator`) of that `computer`. `Administrator accounts` are
**_privileged_**, meaning they can `perform` **_any action_** on the `system`,
with **_minimal restriction_** (usually **requiring** a `password` for
**confirmation**).

A `Windows` **user** does **_not_** have `Administrator` rights **_inside_** the `VS Code Integrated Terminal`. So they are **_restricted_** in what `content` they can **_modify_** in the **_current_** `project folder` they are in. But this can be **_fixed_**. In order **_give yourself_** `Administrator` **rights** in the `VS Code Integrated Terminal`, **_follow_** these steps:

`Right-click` on the `VS Code shortcut` on your `desktop` and **_select_**
`Properties` ub the dropdown that appears.

**_Next_**, `select` the `Compatibility` tab.

**_Next_**, `check` the `Run this program as an administrator` box.

**_Next_**, click `Ok`.

**_Then_**, when you **open up** `VS Code` the **_next time_**, you will be
asked if you **allow** `VS Code` to **make changes** to `content` on your
`computer`. **Select** `Yes`. This will **_enable_** you to **become** an
`administrator` **_inside_** the `VS Code Integrated Terminal`. When I **_set
this up_**, I was **able** to **_start_** `deleting folders` inside
`VS Code’s Integrated Terminal` with my **_local_** `clean script` **inside** my `package.json`. **_However_**, one **_should note_** that when I **run** the `clean script` which entails **_deleting_** a `folder` inside my `project`
called `dist`, I am **prompted** the **_following_** in the
`Integrated Terminal`:

```shell
rmdir /s dist && mkdir distdist, Are your sure (Y/N)?
```

Make sure that you **_type_** a `capital Y` and **_not_** a `lowercase y`. You
**_won’t_** throw an error, but you also **_won’t_** delete the contents of the `dist` **folder**. **_Only_** when you **press** the `Shift key` +
`Y key will the folder(s) be ***deleted***. My `clean script` **consists** of
the **_following_**:

```json
“script”: “rmdir /s dist && mkdir dist”
```

To **_remove_** the step `dist, Are your sure (Y/N)?`, you can **_add_** `/q`
**_after_** `/s`. So:

```json
“script”: “rmdir /s /q dist && mkdir dist”
```

**_Adding_** `/s` (for `Windows XP` and **_later_**) after `rmdir` **_removes_** all `directories` and `files` in the **_specified directory_** in **_addition_** to the `directory` **itself**. **_Adding_** `/q` after `/s` (for `Windows XP` and **_later_**) enables `Quiet mode`, so you are **_not_** asked if it is `ok` to **_remove_** a `directory tree` with `/s`.

The `mkdir dist` command that **_follows_** simply **creates** an empty `dist`
folder. The `&&` **_in between_** simply **enables** the **_execution_** of two commands **_instead_** of **just one**. **_More_** than one **instance** of `&&` is **_possible_**, as will be **demonstrated** in my `createDirs` and `build` scripts.

**_After_** the `clean script` in `package.json` comes the `createDirs script`:

```json
“createDirs”: “cd dist && mkdir \”styles/css\” && mkdir  \”scripts/js\””
```

Because I **_can’t_** create the `styles/css` and `scripts/js` **directory
trees** at the **_same time_** that I **delete** and **re-create** the `dist`
folder, I **_create_** a **separate** `createDirs script`. The **_first_**
`command` in the `script` is to `cd` into (`c`hange `d`irectories) the `dist`
folder, **_followed by_** the `&&` (`double and`), then the `mkdir` command
**_followed by_** `\”styles/css\”`, which **results** in the **_creation_** of a `styles` folder and then a `css` subfolder. The **_reason why_** I **wrap** `styles/css` with `back slashes` (`\`) **_followed by_** `double quotes` (`“`) is because I **_need_** to **write** the `path` for the `styles/css` with a `forward slash` (`/`) in `package.json`, but the `Command Prompt` **_only recognizes_** `\`. This way, we are **regexing** `styles/css` by wrapping it in two backslashes. This results in the replacement of `styles\css` with `styles/css`. One `\` at the **_beginning_** of the `regex`, and one `\` at the **_end_**. This makes it **possible** to use a `value` that `CMD` **normally** would **_not_** recognize and **_throw_** an `error` as a result. Same with `scripts/js` when creating the `\”scripts/js\”` directory tree.

**_Next_** comes the `build script`. It **looks** like the **_following_**:

```json
"build": "xcopy \"styles/css\" \"dist/styles/css\" && xcopy \"scripts/js\" \"dist/scripts/js\" && copy index.html dist"
```

Here, I am **using** the `xcopy` command to **_copy_** the **contents** of the
`\"styles/css\"` directory tree **inside** the `root` of the `project` into
`\"dist/styles/css\”`, which was **created** with the `createDirs` command. This is **_followed by_** a `double and` (`&&`), then **_another_** `xcopy` command **_followed by_** `\"scripts/js\”`. This `command` **_copies_** the `scripts/js` directory tree **_inside_** the `root` of the `project` into
`\"dist/scripts/js\”`, which **also** was **_created_** with the `createDirs`
script. Finally we are left with the `command` that **_copies_** the
`index.html` at the `root` of the `project` into the `dist` folder. Here we
simply **use** the `copy` command **_followed by_** the **name** of the `file`
we want to **_copy_**, and then the `destination directory` (where we want to
**copy** the `file` **_into_**), which is the `dist` folder. And **_here_**, as well as in the `createDirs` script, we have **_more_** than one `double and` (`&&`) going on. This simply means that the `script` should **_only_** run if **all** the `commands` **_chained_** by `double ands` (`&&`) are **_executed_**.

**_Finally_**, I have a `deploy` script for my `gh-pages` **npm package**:

```json
“deploy”: “gh-pages -d dist”
```

This is the **_same_** `command` I **use** either on `Unix` (`Mac OS`)
`Terminal` or `Windows Command Prompt`. This simply **_deploys_** the `dist`
folder, which we first have to `push` to our `origin master` (`remote master`)
branch, and then `run` the `npm run deploy` local script in the
`Command prompt/Integrated Terminal` so that the `dist` folder **_and_** its
contents are **_pushed_** to a `remote branch` on `origin` called `gh-pages`,
**_creating_** the `gh-pages` branch for us at the **_same time_**. Once the
`local commit` has been **_pushed_** to `Github`, where `gh-pages`
**_resides_**, we can **visit** our **_new_** `gh-pages` site there. This is
**_free_** `static hosting` that `Github` **_provides_** for our `static`
(`front end`) `repositories` **_hosted_** there.

There are definitely certain things that the `Windows Command Prompt` **shares** with `Terminal` on `Mac` (`Unix`). For example, when one **_opens_** it from the `search bar` to the **_right_** of the `Windows icon` in the **_lower left_** `corner` of the `computer screen`, it **_points_** to the `computer`’s `home directory`, which is the `Windows user` **_top_** `directory`. On a `Mac`, when one **_first_** opens `Terminal`, it **_also_** takes you to the user's `home` directory.

For example, on **_my_** `Mac`, when I **open** a **_new_** instance of
`Terminal` (`iTerm2` for me), The **_following_** is **_printed_** out in the
`Terminal` window:

```shell
Last login: Sat Sep  4 23:17:34 on ttys000
Marias-MacBook-Pro ॐ  ~:
```

If I **run** the `pwd` (`p`rint `w`orking `d`irectory) command to **_get_** the **actual path** of the **_current_** `directory`, I **get** the **_following_**:

```shell
/Users/mariacam
```

When I **_initially_** open a **_new_** instance of the `Command Prompt` on
`Windows`, the **_following_** is **returned**:

```shell
Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.15063]
(c) 2017 Microsoft Corporation. All Rights reserved.

C:\Users\inter>
```

`Unix` (`OS X`) **uses** `forward slashes` (`/`) for `paths`. `Windows` **uses** `backslashes` (`\`). But **_both_** `point` to the **_equivalent place_** on the `computer`.

When I **_open up_** a `directory` in `VS Code` from the `Command Line`
**using** the `code .` command, and then **_execute_** various commands such as `creating directories` (`mkdir newfoldername`) or **_deleting_** directories (`rm -rf folder name`) from **_within_** the `VS Code Integrated Terminal`, I have **_no_** problems.

**_However_**, when I **try** to **_delete_** directories or make other
**_modifications_** to **content** on my `Windows` computer from **_within_**
the `VS Code Integrated Terminal`, by **_default_**, I am **restricted** as to
what I can do. These `restrictions` are **_removed_** when I make myself
`Administrator` from **_within_** the `VS Code Integrated Terminal`, as I
**explained** **_earlier_**.

For me, in the **_past_**, the `Windows Command Prompt` seemed **confusing** and **un-masterable**. But **_these days_**, there is **_more_** and **_better_** documentation than before. I believe it has to do with `Windows` **_improving_** its `OS user interface`, **_more people_** who used to be on `Mac` **_switching over_**, and the fact that the `pandemic` **_transformed us_** into more of a `DIY` (`Do It Yourself`) **society**. I also **came** to **_realize_** that I should **_not only_** be `mistress` of my `Mac` computer, but my `Windows` computer **_as well_**. **_Especially_** since I **teach others** who may **_either be_** on `Mac` OR on `Windows`.
