It has been a while since I installed `MongoDB` on my `Mac`. In fact, the
version that I had installed was `Mongo 4.2.8`. **_However_**, now things are done a **_bit differently_**. It is also **_highly encouraged_** to **_only install_** `MongoDB` with `Homebrew`.

If you are like me and have **_not installed_** `MongoDB` on your `macOS` for a while, and **_even_** have a `version` of `MongoDB` **_below_** `4.4`, **_a lot_** has `changed` for us **_since then_**.

There **_no longer_** is `MongoDB` to **_install_** with `Homebrew`.
**_According_** to [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57856809/installing-mongodb-with-homebrew), there **_no longer_** is a `mongodb formula` in `homebrew-core`:

> To our users: if you came here because mongodb stopped working for you, we
have removed it from the Homebrew core formulas since it was migrated to a non open-source license.

`MongoDB` now is a `NON open-source license`. Imagine **_that_**.

I **_used_** to **_download_** `MongoDB` using the `.tgz tarball`. And we had a **_whole bunch_** of `steps` to **_go through_** in **_order_** to **_place it_** in the **_right folder_** on our `macOS`. NOW, [MongoDB suggests](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/) `avoiding` **_that_** `route`:

> While MongoDB can be installed manually via a downloaded .tgz tarball as
described in this document, it is recommended to use the brew package manager on your system to install MongoDB if possible. Using a package manager automatically installs all needed dependencies, provides an example mongod.conf file to get you started, and simplifies future upgrade and
maintenance tasks.

It has **_always_** been a **no-brainer** for **_me_** to go the `Homebrew`
**route** when **_installing packages_** on `macOS`, so I **_immediately_**
`complied`. **_However_**, the `sequence` of `commands` is a **_bit different_** now as a **_result_** of the `“non open-source license”` **change**.

I **_did not_** previously install `MongoDB` with `Homebrew`, so I **_did not_** have to do the **_following_** (and **_neither_** does it **_work_** anymore):

```shell
# If you still have the old mongodb installed from homebrew-core
brew services stop mongodb
brew uninstall homebrew/core/mongodb
```

This was **_first posted_** `Sep 11, 2019` on `stackoverflow`, and then
**_updated_** with a [link](https://github.com/mongodb/homebrew-brew) to
[mongodb/homebrew-brew repository](https://github.com/mongodb/homebrew-brew) on `Github` September 28, 2021. The link **_takes you_** to the **_new_** [MongoDB Homebrew Tap](https://github.com/mongodb/homebrew-brew) on `Github`. It **_takes you_** through the **_steps_** to **_install_** the `MongoDB` **community version** **_as opposed to_** the **_premium_** `Enterprise Edition`.

I **_did_** the **_following_**:

```shell
# Use the migrated distribution from custom tap
brew tap mongodb/brew
brew update (always recommended before installing something new)
brew install mongodb-community
brew services start mongodb-community
```

And I was **_good_** to **_go_**! I **_still_** have the **_old_** `Mongo 4.2.8` **version** **_installed_** on my OS, but it **_does not work_**. It is
**_obsolete_**. This will be the **_next thing_** to **figure out**. **_How_** do I **_uninstall_** it, **_if_** at all **_possible_**?
