Recently I created an `audio-visual` **app** that uses the `confetti-js`
library.

I was using `npm` in my **application** **_already_**, so I **decided** to
**_use_** `confetti-js` via `npm`. I checked to see whether there was a
`confetti-js` **npm package**, and there **_was_**!

I checked the `npm package` **documentation** to see how I had to add
`confetti-js` to my **application**. I was using it `"the classic way"`
(`vanilla JavaScript`), as I did **_not_** have any `babel-related` and
`webpack-related` **workflow**, which would have **_permitted me_** to use
`ES6 modules`. This is what was **_suggested_**:

```html
<script src="node_modules/confetti-js/dist/index.min.js"></script>
```

I wasn't **_thinking_** in terms of `gh-pages`, and **_added_** the **package** via **_this_** `script`.

Then I was **told** to do the **_following_** in my ( `main`)`.js` **file**:

```js
const confettiSettings = { target: 'my-canvas' }
const confetti = new ConfettiGenerator(confettiSettings)
confetti.render()
```

But **_of course_**, since I was `deploying` to `gh-pages`, I **_added_** my
`node_modules/` **directory** to my `.gitignore` file. Which **_meant_** that my application would **_not_** **have** any `node_modules` to **access** on **_remote_**.

When I **_deployed_** the **application** to `gh-pages`, I got the **_following error_** in the `Chrome Developer Tools Console`:

```shell
TypeError: ConfettiGenerator is not a constructor
```

Of **_course not_**, because the application **_could not access_** the
`confetti-js` code **inside** the `node_modules/` **_directory_**!

I **_immediately_** **realized** what was **_going on_**, and **searched**
`Google` to see whether there was a `CDNJS` that I could **_use_**. And there was!

I **_added_** the `confetti-js` `CDNJS` to my `script` **tag**, removed the
`confetti-js` `npm package`, and `re-deployed` to `gh-pages`. This time
everything **worked** as **_expected_**.

This is what my `script` **tags** **_look like_** now in my `index.html` file:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/confetti-js@0.0.18/dist/index.min.js"></script>
<script src="scripts/js/main.js"></script>
```

On the **_other_** **hand**, if I had **deployed** to a **_remote hosting
service_** such as `Netlify`, for example, or `zeit.co`, the **instructions** on the `confetti-js` **npm package page** would **work beautifully**, as they **_both_** **build** the **application** using `node_modules`, **_even though_** we **ignore them** in our `.gitignore` files. They go by what we have **_listed_** in our `package.json` **files**.

So **_if_** you are **using** an `npm package` such as `confetti-js`, but are **hosting** your **front-end** **_application_** on `gh-pages`, **_go with_** a `CDNJS` instead of a **reference** to **code** **_residing_** in your `node_modules/` **directory**. It will **_also_** work like a charm! That **_also means_** that you **wouldn't** even **need** to **_install_** the `confetti-js` **package** to **_begin with_**!

On a **_side note_**, now that `Microsoft` **owns** **_both_** `Github`
**_and_** `npm`, there **should** **_also_** be a **reference** to **how** to **_add_** an `npm package` to an **application** that is **_hosted_** on
`Github gh-pages`, if **applicable**! **_Not everyone_** knows, **out of the
box**, about the `CDNJS` **_alternative_**!
