Not only have I been deep diving into shell scripts, but I am also (finally) getting to know AppleScripts. So the first AppleScript I created plays a complete album in the Music App:

```shell
osascript -e 'tell application "Music" to play every track of playlist "Library" whose album is "Death to Analog"'
```

Luckily there is only one album in my Music "Library" called "Death to Analog"
!

After the complete album has been played, the Music app stops playing. And that is it!
