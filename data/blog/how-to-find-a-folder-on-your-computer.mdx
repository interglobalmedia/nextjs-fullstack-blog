I have a lot of folders containing projects on my computer. Sometimes I don't remember where I have placed them! This happened to me recently. The general command to run if you want to look through ALL the directories on your computer is the following:

```shell
find / -type d -name "kali-linux-fundamentals"
```

`"find"` represents the `find` command. `"/"` represents the `top root directory` on my `macOS device`. `-type` followed by the `"type"` I am looking for, which is a `folder`, is then followed by `d`, which represents `"directory"`. `-name` is followed by the `"name"` of the `directory` I am looking for, enclosed in double quotes. However, it could take a long time to go through `ALL directories` on one's `device`, and there also would be a lot of directories which would result in the message `"Permission denied"`. In my case, I knew that all my `developer/cybersecurity` related projects are within a `sub-directory` of my `home directory` called `"development"`. So I did the following:

```shell
find ~/development -type d -name "kali-linux-fundamentals"
```

And this returned:

```shell
/Users/mariacam/development/digital-forensics/kali-linux-fundamentals
```

If I were to use a `relative path` instead, as I typically do to navigate around my macOS device via the CLI (command line interface aka Terminal), I would use `~/development/digital-forensics/kali-linux-fundamentals` to get there from my `home directory` represented by the tilde (`~`).

So if you have a lot of `projects/directories` on your `macOS`, and you want to find out where a particular one is (because you forgot), you can run the above command. I also highly recommend placing related directories, i.e., development-related projects or even slide decks under one root directory, which would be located within your home directory, so that when you have to search for a project, you would not have to search through ALL the directories on your system!
