excerpt:
    How to create a fullstack application using Django and Python Part 5. In
    this section, I discuss and show how one can change a project name after it
    has already been created and migrated. It's really not as difficult as it
    sounds!

## Changing a Django project name after it has already been migrated

`When` I first `created` the `project` for this `Django` site, I `did` not
`think` much `about` the `project name`, and `named` it `basic_django_web_page`.
I `named` the `root directory` of the site `basic-django-web-page.` `But` after
`already` having made `migrations` (`makemigrations`) and then `migrated` the
`site` (`migrate`), I `wanted` to `change` the root directory of the `Django`
site to `django-boards`, and the `project name` to `django_boards`. It `made`
more `sense` and `was` more `consistent` with the `rest` of the
`site namespaces`. I `had` to `change` both `high level` project `directory` to
`django_boards` and the porject `subdirectory` to `django_boards` as well.

But `how` was I `going` to do `this`?

## Researching the name changing issue

I `had` never `changed` a `project name` after making `model migrations`, `but`
I was `determined` to `make` the `name change` so `that` I `would` not `have` to
`re-create` the `site`. `That` simply `would` have `been` a `waste` of `time`.

I `came across` all `sorts` of `solutions` which `just` didn't `work`, so I
`won't` even `bother` mentioning `them`. `Then` I `came across` a `thread` on
`stackoverflow` that `gave me` the `answer`(`s`) I was `looking` for!

## Changing old project name to new project name throughout the Django site

I `typed` in the `old` project `name` in the `Search` (`eyeglass icon`) `field`
in `Visual Studio Code` to quickly `find` out `where` it `came up` in the
`project` code `base`:

1. It appeared in `.gitignore`.
2. It appeared in `manage.py`.
3. It appeared in `asgi.py`.
4. It appeared in `settings.py`.
5. it appeared in `urls.py`.

I `removed` all `instances` of `basic_django_web_page` and `replaced` it with
`django_boards`. This `included` any `reference` to the `project name` in
`string comments`! `Those` references `count` too.

`After` I `did` all `that`, `committed` the `changes`, `pushed` them to
`Github`, and then `tried` to `run` the `development server`, it `worked`.

But... `when` I `went` back `later` to the `same thread` where I `found` my
`solutions`, I `learned` that `there` was `still` more `checking` I `should do`.

## Running the env | grep django command

I `also learned` in the `stackoverflow` thread (listed in `Related Resources`)
that I should `run` the `env | grep django` command to `see` if the `old`
project `name` was `lingering` anywhere in the `virtual environment` (`venv`).
The `following` was `returned` in `Terminal`:

```shell
PATH=/Users/mariacam/Python-Development/basic-django-web-page/venv/bin:/Users/mariacam/.pyenv/shims:/Users/mariacam/.pyenv/bin:/opt/homebrew/bin:/opt/homebrew/sbin:/Users/mariacam/mongodb/bin:/Applications/Postgres.app/Contents/Versions/latest/bin:/Library/PostgreSQL/10/bin:/Users/mariacam/.rbenv/bin:/Users/mariacam/.yarn/bin:/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.12/bin:/Users/mariacam/.nvm/versions/node/v20.15.0/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/Users/mariacam/.rvm/bin
PWD=/Users/mariacam/Python-Development/django-boards/django_boards
OLDPWD=/Users/mariacam/Python-Development/django-boards
VIRTUAL_ENV=/Users/mariacam/Python-Development/basic-django-web-page/venv
```

The `new` project `name` was `recognized`, and `was` also `set` in `all` the
right `places` in the `code base`, i.e., including `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` in
`settings.py`,but the `original` root `directory name` did `appear` in the
`VIRTUAL_ENV` variable.

### Breaking down the env | grep django command

The `env | grep django` command is used to filter environment variables related
to Django.

-   The `env` command lists all the environment variables in the current shell
    session.
-   `|` (pipe) operator pipes the output of the `env` command to the grep
    command.
-   `grep django` searches through the output for lines that contain the string
    `"django"`.

The `env | grep django` command `displays` all `environment variables` that
include `"django"` in their `names` or `values`. This is `useful` when we `want`
to `check` any `environment settings` related to `Django`.

`All` I `had` to `do` to `fix` the `value` of `VIRTUAL_ENV` was the `following`:

1. I `opened` up `venv/bin/activate` in `vim` with the `following command`:

```shell
vim venv/bin/activate
```

2. `Then` I `added` the `following` at the `bottom` of the `file`:

```shell
export VIRTUAL_ENV=/Users/mariacam/Python-Development/django-boards/venv
```

3. `Then` I `ran` the `env | grep django` command `again`, and the `following`
   was `returned`:

```shell
PATH=/Users/mariacam/Python-Development/basic-django-web-page/venv/bin:/Users/mariacam/.pyenv/shims:/Users/mariacam/.pyenv/bin:/opt/homebrew/bin:/opt/homebrew/sbin:/Users/mariacam/mongodb/bin:/Applications/Postgres.app/Contents/Versions/latest/bin:/Library/PostgreSQL/10/bin:/Users/mariacam/.rbenv/bin:/Users/mariacam/.yarn/bin:/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.12/bin:/Users/mariacam/.nvm/versions/node/v20.15.0/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/Users/mariacam/.rvm/bin
PWD=/Users/mariacam/Python-Development/django-boards
OLDPWD=/Users/mariacam/Python-Development/django-boards/django_boards
VIRTUAL_ENV=/Users/mariacam/Python-Development/django-boards/venv
```

Success! My `VIRTUAL_ENV` variable `value` was `updated` to the `correct path`!

And `that` is `how` I `changed` the `name` of my `Django` project from
`basic_django_web_page` to `django_boards`.
