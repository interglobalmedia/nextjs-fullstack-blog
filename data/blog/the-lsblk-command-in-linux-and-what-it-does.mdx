## lsblk introduction

The `lsblk` command comes as part of the `util-linux` package, which is a
`package` comprised of `essential utilities` for `Linux systems`. It `provides`
a wide range of `functionality` including `tools` for `managing files`, `disks`,
and `system resources`. `util-linux` comes installed with Linux Mint, for
example. According to the Linux Mint community,

> (`util-linux`) contains a number of important utilities, most of which are
> oriented towards maintenance of your system. Some of the more important
> utilities included in this package allow you to view kernel messages, create
> new filesystems, view `block device information`, interface with real time
> clock, etc.

## What is the lsblk command and what does it do?

The `lsblk` command stands for `list block devices`, and it provides detailed
information about `block devices` such as `hard drives`, `solid state drives`,
and other `storage related devices` that are `connected` to the `computer`. It
queries the [/sys virtual filesystem](/blog/the-linux-filesystem-hierarchy) and
`udev db` **[^1]** to `obtain` the `information` that it `displays`.

## Installing util-linux if your distro does not have it by default

If by any chance you are not using `Linux Mint`, or `Ubuntu` or an
`Ubuntu derivate` for example, and your `Linux` distro does not contain the
`util-linux` package, you can `install` it:

```shell
# Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt-get install util-linux
# in Linux Mint, I have installed my packages doing sudo apt install packagename. But util-linus is already installed in Linux Mint anyway.
```

## lsblk syntax

The `syntax` for the `lsblk` command is the `following`:

```shell
lsblk [options] [device]
```

`[options]` refers to the `flags` available to the `lsblk` command. `[device]`
refers to the `specific` block devices that we `want` to `list`. If `no device`
is `specified`, `lsblk` will `list` all `block devices`.

## Running the lsblk command

If I run `lsblk` in `Terminal`, it `returns` the `following`:

```shell
NAME   MAJ:MIN RM  SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINTS
sda      8:0    0   50G  0 disk
├─sda1   8:1    0    1M  0 part
├─sda2   8:2    0  513M  0 part /boot/efi
└─sda3   8:3    0 49.5G  0 part /
sr0     11:0    1 50.4M  0 rom  /media/maria/VBox_GAs_7.0.18
```

If I `want` to get `all block devices` including `empty ones`, I would `run` the
`following`:

```shell
lsblk -a
```

`Which` for me `returns`:

```shell
NAME   MAJ:MIN RM  SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINTS
loop0    7:0    0    0B  0 loop
loop1    7:1    0    0B  0 loop
loop2    7:2    0    0B  0 loop
loop3    7:3    0    0B  0 loop
loop4    7:4    0    0B  0 loop
loop5    7:5    0    0B  0 loop
loop6    7:6    0    0B  0 loop
loop7    7:7    0    0B  0 loop
sda      8:0    0   50G  0 disk
├─sda1   8:1    0    1M  0 part
├─sda2   8:2    0  513M  0 part /boot/efi
└─sda3   8:3    0 49.5G  0 part /
sr0     11:0    1 50.4M  0 rom  /media/maria/VBox_GAs_7.0.18
```

If I `want` to `print out` the `information` in `list format`, I would `run` the
`following`:

```shell
lsblk -l
```

`Which` for me `returns`:

```shell
NAME MAJ:MIN RM  SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINTS
sda    8:0    0   50G  0 disk
sda1   8:1    0    1M  0 part
sda2   8:2    0  513M  0 part /boot/efi
sda3   8:3    0 49.5G  0 part /
sr0   11:0    1 50.4M  0 rom  /media/maria/VBox_GAs_7.0.18
```

Now `devices` are `listed` without showing `which ones` are `related` to
`each other` like `with` the `lsblk` command.

If I `run` the `following command` in `Terminal`:

```shell
lsblk -p
```

For me, it `returns` the `following`:

```shell
NAME        MAJ:MIN RM  SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINTS
/dev/sda      8:0    0   50G  0 disk
├─/dev/sda1   8:1    0    1M  0 part
├─/dev/sda2   8:2    0  513M  0 part /boot/efi
└─/dev/sda3   8:3    0 49.5G  0 part /
/dev/sr0     11:0    1 50.4M  0 rom  /media/maria/VBox_GAs_7.0.18
```

The `-p` flag `produces output` in `key value pairs`. The `big difference` here
is the `absolute path` to the `device` as well as the `relationships` between
`related devices` is also `displayed`. To `learn more` about `lsblk`, run
`man lsblk` in `Terminal`.

## Footnotes

**[^1]**: [udev (db)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/udev.7.html) or
`user /dev` is systemd's device manager for the Linux kernel. It manages device
nodes in /dev and handles all user space actions when adding or removing
devices.

According to `man udev`, udev supplies the system software with device events,
manages permissions of device nodes and may create additional symlinks in the
/dev/ directory, or renames network interfaces. The kernel usually just assigns
unpredictable device names based on the order of discovery. Meaningful symlinks
or network device names provide a way to reliably identify devices based on
their properties or current configuration.

The udev daemon,
[systemd-udevd.service(8)](https://manpages.debian.org/bullseye/udev/systemd-udevd.service.8.en.html),
receives device uevents directly from the kernel whenever a device is added or
removed from the system, or it changes its state. When udev receives a device
event, it matches its configured set of rules against various device attributes
to identify the device. Rules that match may provide additional device
information to be stored in the udev database or to be used to create meaningful
symlink names.

All device information udev processes is stored in the udev database and sent
out to possible event subscribers. Access to all stored data and the event
sources is provided by the library libudev.
