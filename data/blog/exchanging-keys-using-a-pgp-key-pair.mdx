This article `assumes` that you have `already created` a `PGP key pair`. If not,
`please visit` my `article` entitled
[Making and verifying digital signatures using GPG in Linux](/blog/making-and-verifying-digital-signatures-using-gpg-in-linux).

## Exporting the PGP public key

In `order` to `share` our `public key` with `others`, we can:

1. Hand it to them.
2. Email it to them.
3. Place it online (your website or blog, for example).
4. Store our key on a keyserver for others to fetch.

For options `1`, `2`, or `3`, we have to `export` our `public key` using the
`--export` option. However, we `need` to `transform` it `into` a
`manageable format`. We `shouldn't use` the `raw binary data` which can `cause`
all `sorts` of `issues` including `not` being `transmittable` via `email`. In
`order` to `achieve` this, `gpg` can generate `ASCII armored output` for `us`
when we `use` the `--armor` (or `-a`) option.

In `order` to `export` my `public key`, I `run` the `following command` in
`Terminal`:

```shell
gpg --armor --export Maria > maria_publickey.asc
```

The `--export` option `either` exports `all keys` from `all keyrings`
(`default keyring` and 1 via option `--keyring`), or if `at least` one `name` is
`given`, `those` of the `given name`. The `exported keys` are `written` to
`stdout` or `to` the `file given` with the option `--output`. `Use together`
with `--armor` to `email` those `keys`.

The `--armor` option creates `ASCII` armored `output`. The `default` is to
`create` the `binary` OpenPGP `format`. `By default`, a `key` is `exported` in
`binary format`. `As` mentioned `earlier`, `this` is `not transmittable` via
`email`.

`After exporting` my `key` as above, I now `have` a `copy` of my `public key`.
And if I `ls` the `current working directory`, a `new file` called
`maria_publickey.asc` appears.

## Sending maria_publickey.asc to another local user via email

Next, I can `send` my `maria_publickey.asc` file to `another user` on the
`local network` via `email` in the `following way` via `Terminal`:

```shell
mutt -s "Sending Maria public key file" -a maria_publickey.asc -- magdala@maria-VirtualBox
# I'm taken into nano text editor in mutt where at the bottom of the window is the following:
To: magdala@maria-VirtualBox # then I hit return and the following appears:
Subject: Sending Maria public key file # then I hit return and am taken into another window in nano where I type the body of the email where the white cursor is at the top of the window
Hi Magdala,

I am attaching my public key file called maria_publickey.asc for you to use. Thanks!

Best regards,

Maria
# then I hit Control + O key followed by the Return key
# then I hit Control + X key and this takes me to my mutt mailbox where I select the email I want to send by using either the up or down arrow
# after I have selected the email I just wrote and want to send, I press the y key. This results in "mail sent" appearing at the bottom of the window, and then I am taken back to the Terminal command prompt.
```

I `will` be `writing` a `separate article` about `how` to `set up` the `mutt`
email client, `write emails` to `other users` locally, and `attach files` which
can then be `saved locally` by the `recipient`(`s`).

## Email recipient user magdala imports the maria_publickey.asc

Next, `user magdala` has to `open` the `email` that `she has` just `received`.

For `user magdala` to `be able` to `use` my `public key`, she `has` to `run` the
`following` in `Terminal`:

```shell
gpg --import maria_publickey.asc
```

And the `following` is then `stdout` in `Terminal`:

```shell
gpg: key xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx public key "Maria (GPG key pair for local testing with correct email) <maria#maria-VirtualBox>" imported
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:               imported: 1
```

I would `do` the `same thing` when `importing` magdala's public key:

```shell
gpg --import magdala_publickey.asc
```

`Once` a `public key` has been `imported`, we should `sign it`.

## Signing the imported public key maria_publickey.asc

`Now` that `user magdala` has `imported` my `public key`, she can `run` the
`following command` in `Terminal`:

```shell
gpg --edit-key Maria
```

Which `returns` the `following`:

```shell
gpg (GnuPG) 2.4.4: Copyright (C) 2024 g10 Code GmbH

gpg> fpr
# which returns:

# once fingerprint has been verified with the owner, the key is ready for signing
gpg> sign
# and the following is returned:
gpg: no default secret key No secret key
# then to double check that the public key has been signed:
gpg> check

gpg>
```

The `reason` that `this` has `happened` is because `user magdala` has
`not created` her `PGP key pair`. She `has` to `do` that `now` after
`exiting out` of `editing` key `Maria`).

`When` the `PGP key pair` has been `successfully created` (`check out` my
`article`
[Making and verifying digital signatures using GPG in Linux](http://localhost:3000/blog/making-and-verifying-digital-signatures-using-gpg-in-linux)
for a refresher), `user magdala` can now `edit` the `Maria key pair`:

```shell
gpg --edit-key Maria

     Maria (GPG key pair for local testing witb correct email) <maria@maria-VirtualBox>

Are you sure that you want to sign this key with your key "magdala (This is the second PGP key pair I am creating for local testing because I lost the passphrase for the first one) <magdala@maria-VirtualBox>" (xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx)

Really sign? (y/N) y # then user prompted for their passphrase

gpg> check

gpg>
Save changes? (y/N) y # then hit Control + D key to exit out of gpg command prompt
```

## Exporting magdala_publickey.asc

To `export` the magdala `public key`, first `user magdala` runs the
`following command` in `Terminal`:

```shell
gpg --armor --export magdala > magdala_publickey.asc
```

Which `results` in the `creation` of the file `magdala_publickey.asc`.

`Before sending` her `public key` to `user Maria`, `user magdala` should
`create` a `revocation certificate` in `case` if the `key pair` is `lost` or
`compromised`.

## Creating the revocation certificate for magdala PGP key pair

`In order` to `create` a `revocation certificate` for `user magdala`'s
`PGP key pair`, she `has` to `run` the `following command` in `Terminal`:

```shell
gpg --output ~/revocation.crt --gen-revoke magdala@maria-VirtualBox

sec rsa3072/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx  2024-08-14 magdala (This is tjhe second PGP key pair I am creating for local testing because I lost the passphrase for the first one) <magdala@maria-VirtualBox>

Create a revocation certificate for this key? (y/N) y
Pleas select the reason for the revocation:
     0 = No reason specified
     1 = Key has been compromised
     2 = Key is superseded
     3 = Key is no longer used
     Q = Cancel
(Probably you want to select 1 here)
Your decision? 0
Enter an optional description; end it with an empty line:
>
Reason for revocation: No reason specified
(No description given)
Is this okay? (y/N) youASCII armored output forced.
Revocation certificate created

Please move it to a medium which you can hide away; if Mallory gets access ton this certificate he can use it to make your key unusable. It is smart to print this certificate and store it away, just in case your media become unreadable. But have some caution: The print system or your machine might store the data and make ot available to others!
magdala@maria-VirtualBox:~$
```

User magdala is also prompted for the magdala PGP key pair passphrase during the
process as well.

The reason why it is a good idea to immediately create a revocation certificate
after generating a PGP key pair is because a revocation certificate CANNOT be
created for a PGP key pair AFTER it has been lost compromised.

## Immediately changing permissions for revocation.crt

Once user magdala has generated her revocation certificate, she should
immediately change the permissions for her revocation.crt file using the chmod
command:

```shell
chmod 600 ~/revocation.crt
```

Then, to confirm her change in permissions, she can run
`ls -l ~/revocation.crt`, and the following is returned:

```shell
-rw------ 1 magdala magdala 719 Aug 14 08:13 /home/magdala/revocation.crt
magdala@maria-VirtualBox:~$
```

## Emailing magdala_publickey.asc to user Maria

Now `user magdala` has to `send` her `public key` file to `user Maria`, so she
`runs` the following in `Terminal`:

```shell
mutt -s "Sending magdala public key file" -a magdala_publickey.asc -- maria@maria-VirtualBox
```

And the `following appears` when she `hits` the `Return` key:

```shell
mutt -s "Sending magdala public key file" -a magdala_publickey.asc -- maria@maria-VirtualBox
# user magdala is taken into nano text editor in mutt where at the bottom of the window is the following:
To: maria@maria-VirtualBox # then she hits return and the following appears:
Subject: Sending magdala public key file # then she hits return and is taken into another window in nano where she types the body of the email where the white cursor is at the top of the window
Hi Maria,

I am attaching my public key file called magdala_publickey.asc for you to use. Thanks!

Best regards,

Magdala
# then she hits Control + O key followed by the Return key
# then she hits Control + X key and this takes her to her mutt mailbox where she selects the email she wants to send by using either the up or down arrow
# after she has selected the email she just wrote and wants to send, she presses the y key. This results in "mail sent" appearing at the bottom of the window, and then she is taken back to the Terminal command prompt.
```

Now user Maria and user magdala have swapped public keys via the mutt email
client in Linux! Next will be to send files to each other, use their public keys
to encrypt, and their secret keys to decrypt. This will be the next article in
the series after the article on the mutt email client in Linux. Stay tuned for
both!

## User Maria imports magdala_publickey.asc

Now user Maria has to import `magdala_publickey.asc` by `running`
the` following command` in `Terminal`:

```shell
gpg --import magdala_publickey.asc
# which returned:
gpg: key xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx: public key "magdala (This is the second GPG key pair I am creating for local testing because I lost the passphrase for the first one) <magdala@maria-VirtualBox>" imported
gpg:      Total number processed: 1
gpg:                    imported: 1
maria@maria-VirtualBox:~$
```

Now both users are ready to share data using each others' public keys!
