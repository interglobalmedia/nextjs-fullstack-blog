## The su command

The `su` command in `Linux` and `Unix` stands for `switch user` or
`substitute user`. I mention it in my article
[setuid, setgid, and sticky bit in Linux and Unix (macOS)](http://localhost:3000/blog/setuid-setgid-and-sticky-bit-in-linux-and-unix-macos),
but there is much more to it than what i discussed in passing.

## Using su without any arguments

If we run `su` without any arguments (alone), it `defaults` to `running` an
`interactive shell` as the `root user`. If I run `su` alone in `Linux` (or
`Unix`), `something like` the `following happens`:

```shell
Password:
Authentication failure
```

Because I `never set` a `password` for `root` when I **_installed_**
`Linux Mint` in `VirtualBox` on `Windows 11`. But it still `asks` for a
`password`. According to a
[Linux Mint forum](https://forums.linuxmint.com/viewtopic.php?t=370898#google_vignette),
running `su` alone in order `to run` an `interactive shell` as `root` does `not`
work in `Linux Mint`. **_However_**, I can run `sudo su` since I have access to
`sudo`, and it achieves the same thing. When I run `sudo su`, the `following` is
`returned` as `stdout` in `Terminal`:

```shell
root@maria-VirtualBox/home/maria#
```

In order to `logout` of the `interactive shell` as `root`, I run
`su --login maria`. I am `not asked` for my `password` **_another time_** since
I already gave it in order to `run` the `interactive shell` as `root` in the
first place.

In `Linux` (`Linux Mint`), `su` is `mostly designed` for `unprivileged users`.

## su username

When `su` is `followed by` a `username`, `additional arguments` can be
`specified`. but `when` only `username` is `specified`, the `current user`
**_does switch_** to `another user`, but the `environment` of the
`previous user` remains the `same`. For example, if I `switch out` of
`user maria` into `user magdala` by running `su magdala`, the `following` is
`returned` in `Terminal`:

```shell
magdala@maria-VirtualBox:/home/maria
```

And when I `run` the `whoami` command, `magdala` is `returned` in `Terminal`.
**_However_**, even though I have `switched users`, `user maria`'s
`home directory` and c`ontents` remains the `same`. `User magdala` can't really
do anything in this state. It is a good way of `checking` how well `permissions`
and `ownership` are `working`. And only `user maria` logged in as `user maria`
can `change` file `permissions` or `ownership`.

## su -, su -l, and su --login

If I run `su --login magdala` instead of simply `su magdala`, the `following`
would be `returned` in `Terminal`:

```shell
magdala@maria-VirtualBox:~
```

Now `user magdala` has truly `logged into` her own `environment`. I can tell
because `/home/maria` is `no longer` **_appended to_**
`magdala@maria-VirtualBox:`. `user magdala` now `has` her own `home directory`,
`/home/magdala`. I can `check` by `running` the `pwd` command, which returns
`/home/magdala`. Now `user magdala` can `create` and `delete files` and
`directories`, navigate from one directory to another with the `cd` command, and
so on.

`su - username` and `su -l username` **_login_** `users` into their
`own environment` in the `same way` as `su --login username`. `Linux`
(`Linux Mint`) `man su` recommends using `su --login username` "in order to
avoid side effects caused by mixing environments". Running `su username` also
`mixes environments`.

According to `man su`,

> `su` defaults to not change the current directory and to only set environment
> variables HOME and SHELL (plus USER and LOGNAME if the target user is not
> root).

The `--login` option `starts` the `shell` as a `login shell` with an
`environment` **_similar_** to a `real login`:

-   It `clears` the `environment variables` **_except_** `TERM` **[^1]**, and
    `variables` specified by `--whitelist-environment` **[^2]**.

-   It `initializes` the environment variables `HOME`, `SHELL`, `USER`,
    `LOGNAME` **[^3]**, and `PATH` **[^4]**.

-   It changes to the target user's home directory.

-   It sets arv[0] of the shell to '-' in order to make the shell a login shell.

There are other options available to `su` which can be found by running `man su`
(the `su` manual), but the above are the most important to know.

### Footnotes

**[^1]**: The [TERM](https://www.baeldung.com/linux/term-environment-variable)
environment variable is a variable that indicates the terminal type. A terminal
type specifies the model of the terminal emulator. Some of the popular terminal
types include xterm, [xterm-256color](https://robotmoon.com/256-colors/),
[vt100](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VT100),
[gnome-terminal](https://help.gnome.org/users/gnome-terminal/stable/), and
[rxvt-unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rxvt). Each of these terminal types
provides different capabilities.

**[^2]**: The `--white-list-environment` option specifies environment variables
list that should not be reset when switching users.

**[^3]**: The LOGNAME environment variable is the same as the USER environment
variable. It provides the name of the currently logged in user.

**[^4]**:
[Modern `su`](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/466373/setting-the-root-path-for-su)
no longer resets PATH environment variable from the caller (`su`) when asked to
preserve the environment. If this needs to happen, use `--login`.
