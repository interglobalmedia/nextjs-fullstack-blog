I came across a problem which I wanted to solve. It could even prove quite
practical. It involved joining two text files. However, the order of the columns
were not the same, and in order for the join command to work, they had to be the
same.

I called the first file `file1.txt`, and it contained the following:

```shell
John  1

Jane  2

Mary  3
```

I called the second file `file2.txt`, and it contained the following:

```shell
1 Doe

2 Doe

3 Sue
```

What differs between the two files? For one, in file1.txt, column 1 is populated
by people's first names followed by a number column. In `file2.txt`, column 1 is
populated by numbers, and column 2 contains people's last names. So if I were to
try to join the two files without manipulating their content with the following
command:

```shell
join file1.txt file2.txt
```

it would result in the following output in `Terminal`:

```shell

```

Exactly. Nothing would output to the `Terminal`. It took me a little while to
figure out what to do, but I did know that I would have to switch the order of
the columns in `file1.txt` so that it would match the order of the columns in
`file2.txt`. I initially couldn't figure it out with join (I subsequently did
later on), but I did come across the `awk` command, which even now just seems
more intuitive and much more flexible. I ended up doing the following:

```shell
awk '{ t=$1; $1=$2; $2=t; print }' file1.txt > file1a.txt
join file1a.txt file2.txt
```

The first line of the script resulted in a third file called `file1a.txt`, and
it contained the following:

```shell
1 John

2 Jane

3 Mary
```

The order of `file1a.txt` matched the order of `file2.txt`. This made it easy to
`join` the contents of the two files represented in line 2 of the code.
`join file1a.txt file2.txt` resulted in the following in Terminal:

```shell
1 John Doe

2 Jane Doe

3 Mary Sue
```

This is exactly what I wanted to achieve.

So what is the `awk` command and why is it so powerful? According to `man awk`
(`awk` manual built into `Terminal`),

> `awk` is a pattern-directed scanning and processing language. `awk` scans each
> input file for lines that match any of a set of patterns specified literally
> in prog or in one or more files specified as -f progfile. With each pattern
> there can be an associated action that will be performed when a line of a file
> matches the pattern.

`awk` was perfect for the task at hand:

> An `input line` is normally made up of `fields` separated by `white space`, or
> by the regular expression `FS`. The `fields` are denoted `$1`, `$2`, ...,
> while `$0` refers to the entire line.

Now let's break down the code. `awk` is a macOS built-in command, which is
convenient, and it dates back to early Linux (and Unix). It is part of the
[POXIX standard](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1780599/what-is-the-meaning-of-posix),
which makes application programming interfaces provided by Unix-y operating
systems (and ancillary issues, such as command line shell utilities) more
comprehensible and consistent. This then allows for code portability across
various Unix derivatives, including Linux and macOS. `awk` is great for solving
issues in our data files.

After the `awk` command is:

```shell
'{ t=$1; $1=$2; $2=t; print }'
```

`'{}'` denotes encapsulating the complete code to manipulate the file that
follows and that it should be executed all together. `t` denotes an arbitrarily
chosen variable and `$1` represents field one (aka column). `$1=$2` means that
column 1 now equals column 2, and `$2=t` means column 2 now equals t, meaning
that column 2 now is replacing column one, so column 1 now positioned where
column 2 originally was positioned, and column 1 is now positioned where column
2 was originally positioned. Column 1 has switched positions with column 2,
resulting in the following in `Command Line`:

```shell
# file1.txt
1 John

2 Jane

3 Mary
```

`print` simply means to print the output of the command. `file1.txt` represents
the file to manipulate.

I also wanted to make sure to be able to preserve the file manipulation on
file1.txt, so I redirected the manipulation into a new file called file1a.txt,
which was created at the same time as the redirection, represented by `>`. The
contents of file1a.txt was the following;

```shell
1 John

2 Jane

3 Mary
```

which is exactly what I wanted, as previously indicated. Which made it then
possible to run the following command in `Terminal`:

```shell
join file1atxt > file2.txt
```

which resulted in the following:

```shell
1 John Doe

2 Jane Doe

3 Mary Sue
```

I subsequently found out that there is an even shorter version of this `awk`
command, very similar to the `join` command (which I will discuss shortly):

```shell
awk '{ print $2, $1 }' file1.txt
```

In this case, `print` has to precede `$2, $1`. Why? Because print has to precede
the fields it will print. In the original example, the fields were being saved
into variables first, so print was placed at the end. I still had to add
`> file1a.txt` after `awk '{ print $2, $1 }'` in order to preserve the temporary
changes made to `file1.txt` output to the `Command Line`.

The similar `join` command which changes the column/field order of one file to
match the other file is the following:

```shell
join -1 2 -2 1 file1.txt file2.txt
```

which results in the following in `Terminal`:

```shell
1 John Doe

2 Jane Doe

3 Mary Sue
```

`-1` refers to `file1.txt` and `-2` refers to `file2.txt`. And the non minus
number that follows represents the column position it will be switched to.

In this case, it is definitely shorter and therefore easier to use the join
command, but the original `awk` command definitely clarified what was going on
under the hood, which then made it very easy to figure out the `join` command.

I'm glad I had a chance to use `awk`, and will continue to explore it. But I am
also glad I got to know `join` better!
