***[CleanMyMac](https://cleanmymac.macpaw.com/20) macOS cleaner, performance monitor, malware remover***

***Recently*** I have ***been having*** `major problems` ***with*** `VS Code` on my `Mac`. ***First*** under `High Sierra`, and ***since*** `this morning`, `Mojave`.

I ***uninstalled*** the ***first time*** around ***using*** the ***application*** `Clean My Mac X`.
***Apparently*** the ***quick uninstall*** was ***not complete***. I ***decided*** to ***see*** if there was ***something*** I ***missed*** the ***first time*** around.

***When*** I ***upgraded*** to `Mojave`, my `VS Code` ***installation*** disappeared. I had
***uninstalled*** it and ***re-installed*** it, ***thinking*** that it was a `clean uninstall`. I
***uninstalled*** because `VS Code` had ***become corrupt***, and I ***wanted*** to `start over`. But
`that installation` ***didn’t seem*** to ***stick*** when I ***upgraded*** to `Mojave`. ***Couldn’t find*** it ***anywhere except*** in my ***home directory*** on my `Mac`.

I ***went into*** the `Clean My Mac X` ***application***, and ***found*** that ***one*** of the ***tasks*** it ***does*** for you is `uninstall applications`. I ***went into*** the U`ninstaller` ***tab*** which `housed` ***all*** the ***applications*** I ***have installed*** on `my computer`, and ***found*** that `Visual Studio Code`
was ***still*** `completely installed` on ***my computer***. I had ***tried previously*** to
***uninstall manually*** via `Command Line` ***as well***, but to ***no avail***. So I ***tried*** to
***uninstall*** via `Clean My Mac X` ***selecting every*** single ***piece*** of my `Visual Studio Code` ***install***. ***This time*** it was ***successful***!

I `usually` ***don’t do*** `this`, but I ***highly recommend*** `Clean My Mac X`, *`“The ultimate
cleaner for your Mac”`*. *Without it*, I would ***not*** have ***been able*** to get ***rid of***
`Visual Studio Code`. There ***seems*** to be ***no*** `apparent way` of actually ***being able*** to
***uninstall*** it `like with` ***most applications*** where they ***come with*** an ***uninstaller***.

***So far***, my ***clean*** `re-install` SEEMS to ***be working*** . I will ***keep*** `everyone posted` if that ***changes***!
