I have written about this topic before, but feel the need to
re-address it.

[Node Security/npm audit](https://blog.npmjs.org/post/175511531085/the-node-security-platform-service-is-shutting) **_appeared_** for the **first time** in my **_Terminal window_** in **March of last year** (**2018**). I had read that it was a **_new feature_** in **npm**
created by **Node Security**, and was excited about the prospect of knowing more about what was going on under the hood with my **npm packages** and how that all boded for **Web/Software Development** and **Individual Machine(s) Security**. Previously, many of us were under the false impression that everything in our code, in our workflows using third party plugins and packages passed muster. But the minute npm audit came along and we downloaded various npm packages, added libraries and frameworks using those packages, or simply learned from other code using the tooling etc, if there were "known" vulnerabilities in any of the code, **Node Security** (now part of **npmjs**) would print out something like this:

```shell
ॐ  ~/development/testing-javascript/js_mocking_fundamentals/1_override_object_props_monkey_patching_js:

The first time I had done this, I was in a **_full stack JS_** class (**_not_** the boot camp by the same name, another school which has since then closed down), and we were told to clone a repo which had been created 2 YEARS before. We all did so, and I **received** a **_message_** in **Terminal** from **Node Security** on download, that there were around 1,000 vulnerabilities in the project. I mentioned it to the teacher, but he looked at me as if I had three heads. That was a little over a year ago. March, 2018, to be more exact.

You know what? It seems that there are still people in "teaching" positions who don't bother to check their repos, even though, most probably, **Github** is sending them security alerts regarding such vulnerabilities.

So **_this podcast_** is for those who might be **_new_** to the **JavaScript Developer** **_ecosystem_**, and might see similar warnings when cloning or downloading courses they have paid for and want to learn the **_best_** and **_latest_** **practices** from. Apparently, many teachers of courses don't bother to share this kind of information because it just is **_"not relevant"_** to their **subject matter**. You'd better bet your bottom dollar it is. It is relevant to **_everything_** **JavaScript**, and **_everything_** **all other programming languages**.

If, when you clone or download something from a repository, and then run `npm i` (assuming there is a `package.json` present), and there is a message
(**correction: npmjs and not Node Security**) stating that it has detected
vulnerabilities in your package(s), follow their instructions to **_run_**
`npm audit`.

Oftentimes, there is already a **remediation/patch/package** update that will **_remove_** the **vulnerabilities**. Follow the instructions you **_receive_** in **Terminal** after running `npm audit`. Sometimes there is no remediation yet, or it might be difficult for you to do manually. That's when you should contact the creator/maintainer of the repository or package.

Sometimes things take a little while. After all, these packages are open source. Sometimes, however, it is not a matter of fixing the vulnerabilities in a current version of a package by simply updating to the latest version, but updating one that **results in** **_breaking changes_**. That's when things get a bit ugly. Sometimes developers are too lazy to have to do a complete overhaul of their workflows associated with those breaking changes, and this results in vulnerabilities in the current package(s) version(s) that won't go away. This is especially NOT COOL when it happens within course code that you have paid good money for. If the creator of the course has not updated the code/curriculum in more than 6 months or even 3 months (things these days are changing daily),
think twice before signing up for it. Do a bit of **detective work** regarding the **_dependencies_** and **_devDependencies_** in the `package.json` before making your final decision. Of course, sometimes we don't have access to this information until we have actually paid for it. I don't have an answer for that.

**Note:** Be sure to do the same in your own open source repositories. It is
hard to keep up with **Github** **_security alerts_**, but just do your best to do so as you can. The longer you wait, the more complicated the remediation.
