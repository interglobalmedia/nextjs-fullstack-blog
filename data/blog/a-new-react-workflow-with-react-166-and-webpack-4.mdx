***Screenshot of a slide from the React Workflows presentation slide deck***

To ***view*** the **_second edition_** of my **custom React workflow**, ***please visit*** the [react-workflow-updated-2018](https://github.com/interglobalmedia/react-workflow-updated-2018) `repository` on `Github`.

I ***just finished*** `updating` the **_first iteration_** of my `React workflow` to
***reflect changes*** in `React 16.6` and `Webpack 4.3.0`. ***A lot*** has ***changed*** since ***last year*** when I ***put*** my ***last workflow*** together and ***documented*** it.

***Now*** it’s a ***matter*** of ***updating*** that `documentation`. I am ***starting*** that ***today***! What ***prompted me*** to ***start sooner*** than I ***expected*** was the ***following article*** `shared` on `Twitter` ***this morning***:

>["Free software is suffering because coders don’t know how to write documentation"](https://t.co/yIAMZolG30) *via* [@thenextweb](https://twitter.com/TheNextWeb?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) — *docToolchain (@docToolchain)* [November 7, 2018](https://twitter.com/docToolchain/status/1060105284105003009?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

***This*** is ***indeed*** a `big problem`, and the ***article*** is ***worth*** the `read`!

***Below*** I `share` ***my*** `original` [React Workflow presentation](https://interglobalmedia.github.io/react-workflow-presentation/#/) ***from*** `last year` and ***my*** `original` [Evolution of Design And Development presentation/documentation](https://interglobalmedia.github.io/evolution-in-design-and-development/#0) ***from*** `last year` ***as well***. 

***When*** I had ***first added*** `CSS modules` **_functionality_**, I had ***done so*** to an `app` ***created with*** [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md). ***This time***, I ***add*** it to **_my own_** `React workflow` I ***use*** in a `React`
***application*** NOT ***created*** with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
