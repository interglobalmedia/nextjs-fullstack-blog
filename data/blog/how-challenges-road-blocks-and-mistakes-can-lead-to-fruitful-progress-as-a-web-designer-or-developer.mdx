The other day, one of my students was having **_problems_** **pushing** his
**local repository** `source code` to his **_remote_** `Github repository`. He also needed **guidance** in **_organizing_** his `repository content`. I
**_worked_** **with him** in **_organizing_** his `repository content` into
**_different_** **folders** by doing the following:

-   I forked his repository. Yes! Forking was revisited!

-   I git cloned the fork to my laptop.

-   I made the necessary organizational changes to the project content.

-   I made sure to git pull upstream master (the branch in question) for
    (potential) changes that might have been made by him on remote after my last
    upstream update without my knowledge.

-   I pushed my changes to my forked repository.

-   I created a pull request on his original repository.

-   He merged that pull request.

The `key` to all this is, that we `coordinated` the `pull request`. I **_made sure_** that he did **not push** any more **changes** to **_remote_**, because that **might have** **_resulted_** in **merge conflicts**! After he **_merged_** the `pull request`, he could **continue** **_pushing changes_** to **remote**
**_without_** **having to worry** that I **_might_** be **making changes** to the **same content** in my **_forked repository_**, and then **create** a
`pull request`. Road blocks **_organically evolved_** into his **learning more** about a `skill` **_essential_** to any `designer`, `developer`, or **_any other_** `role` in `technology` today. Git. It also **_indirectly_** AND **_directly_** helps one **become** a **_better_** `designer`, `developer`, or **other** `related technology role`. I love it when `evolution` of any sort is **_organic_**! It just **_naturally_** **happens**. And that **_comes from_** `collaborative effort` on **both sides** and a **_willingness_** (AND **_eagerness_**) to **learn**. Most **_important_** of all, to **get the job done** within a **_certain time frame_**!
