I recently ***left*** `teaching` so I could `focus` on “me” ***more***, and ***address*** my `needs`, `desires`, `reconnect to self`, and my `business`. ***Much*** of my `business` is `“teaching”` ***others***, but on my ***own terms***.

***Recently*** I ***asked myself*** the `question`, “How did I get here? Why am I doing what I am doing?”

When `talking` about this ***with others***, I ***always*** go back to the ***same*** `“memory/story”`. When I used to be in the beauty industry and was doing graphic design, I ***worked closely*** with an ***outsourced*** `tech support` team. I ***used*** to watch them ***working*** in the `macOS` (***then*** `OSX`) `Command Line`, and ***doing*** other really cool ***tech related*** `tasks` on the `computer`, and I ***used*** to ***say***, “I wish I could learn how to do stuff like that. I don’t think I could ever do that!’ And ***deep down*** inside, I ***hoped*** for ***such*** an ***opportunity***.

I got my ***first*** "neighboring opportunity" when I ***found*** the ***need*** to ***build*** my own `website` ***because*** I ***couldn’t*** find anyone to `build` the ***kind*** of `site` I ***wanted***. ***Back then***, everyone was `building` ***one page*** `Adobe Flash` ***sites***. I ***wanted*** to ***build*** an ***online*** `daily publication`. This was ***many*** years ago.

Then I ***wanted*** to ***get into*** `web development`, and I ***had*** to ***cknow*** `Command Line`, `Git`, `npm`, `Node.js`, ***etc***. `Command Line` (`Terminal`) ***was*** an ***integral part*** of `web development`.

Then I ***went into*** `teaching` at `college level`. ***There***, I started ***losing touch*** with a ***great part*** of my `vision`. The `mission` I had `developed` ***over time***, which was to ***teach others*** who ***wanted*** to `increase` their what I call `”technological intelligence”`, started to ***fade away***.

***So often*** I ***would hear*** “So and so should not have to learn this.”. Or ”This is too difficult or overwhelming for so and so”. This ***happens often*** `across disciplines` as well as `education` ***in general***. But in this ***day*** and ***age*** of ***rapid*** `technological advancement` and `security breaches`, ***everyone*** should ***work on*** their `technological intelligence`. I am ***not saying*** that ***everyone*** `should become` a `developer` or an `IT professional`, for example. I’m ***saying*** that ***everyone*** should become ***acquainted with*** and ***better understand*** the `technologies` which ***make up*** an ***integral part*** of their ***daily lives***. 

Let’s ***take it*** a ***step further***. ***Just*** as it ***was*** for ***me*** and ***others*** after me with `math` and `science` ***being part*** of our `core` (and ***required***) `education`, I would ***like*** to ***see*** ***some form*** of `computer science`, `web/mobile development`, and `information technology` also ***become*** a ***part*** of the ***core*** `educational curriculum`. This ***presents*** an ***opportunity*** for people to be ***exposed*** to ***such knowledge***, thereby making ***better*** `educated decisions` on what `career path` to take ***earlier*** in ***life***.

I also ***would like*** to see ***more women*** take an ***interest*** in the `tech industry`, and ***receive*** `more support` and `guidance` ***as well***.

`“Technological intelligence”` is to take ***more control*** of `your life` by taking ***more control*** over the `technologies` you ***depend*** on ***before*** they (or the `people` who ***represent*** those `technologies`)  ***take control*** of ***you***. ***Agree*** or ***disagree***?
