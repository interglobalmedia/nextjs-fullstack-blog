## Creating a new local Git repository

`Recently`, I `created` a `new` local `Git` repository `called`
`custom-abstract-base-user-model`. `Then` I `initialized` Git `with` the
`following command`:

```shell
git init
```

### Checking out into new branch called create-config-project-and-users-app

`However`, `instead` of `immediately making` my `first commit` to a
`remote repository` on `GitHub`, I `checked out` into `a` new `branch` called
`create-config-project-and-users-app`:

```shell
git checkout -b create-config-project-and-users-app
```

### Trying to check out into main branch after committing changes in create-config-project-and-users-app

`Then`, after `adding` all the `features` I `wanted` to `add` to that `branch`
and `committing` my `changes`, I `ran` the `following command`:

```shell
git checkout main
```

Which `returned` the `following` in `Terminal`:

```shell
error: pathspec 'main' did not match any file(s) known to git
```

### Creating a new branch called main in create-config-project-and-users-app and checking out into main all at once

I `never` actually `"created"` a `main` branch, `because` I never `committed`
anything. I simply `checked out` into a `new branch`, `and` any `content` I had
`created` in `"main"`, was `checked into` the `new branch` as well. `This` was
`fine`! I `had` to `create` a `main` branch `that` I `could` check `into`, merge
`create-config-project-and-users-app` into `main`, `and` then `push` to
`remote origin` on `GitHub`. To `make` this `happen`, I `ran` the
`following command`:

```shell
git checkout -b main create-config-project-and-users-app
```

What `this` command `means` is `that` I am `creating` a `new branch` called
`main` from a `branch` called `create-config-project-and-users-app`, `and` then
`checking` out `into` the `new` main `branch`.

### Creating the remote repository on GitHub and add adding remote origin

`Then`, I `had` to `create` my `remote repository` on `GitHub`, `followed` by
`running` the `following` in `Terminal`:

```shell
 git remote add origin git@github.com:interglobalmedia/custom-abstract-base-user-model.git
```

### Merging create-config-project-and-users-app into main branch and pushing changes to remote origin

`Then` I `ran` the `following command`:

```shell
git merge create-config-project-and-users-app --no-ff
```

Which `returned`:

```shell
Already up to date.
```

`This` was `because` when I `checked` out `into` the `new` main `branch`, the
`changes` I `made` in `create-config-project-and-users-app` were "merged" into
`main`. `All` I `had` to `do` was `run` the `following command`:

```shell
git push -u origin main
```

Which `returned` the `following` in `Terminal`:

```shell

```

## Conclusion

`In` this `post`, `I` discussed `creating` a new `local` Git `repository`,
`checking` out `into` a `new branch` called
`create-config-project-and-users-app`, `trying` to `check` out `into` main
`branch` after `committing changes` in `create-config-project-and-users-app`,
and `after` not `succeeding`, `creating` a new `branch` called `main` in
`create-config-project-and-users-app` and `checking` out `into` main `all` at
`once`, `creating` the `remote repository` on `GitHub`, `adding` remote
`origin`, merging `create-config-project-and-users-app` into `main`, `and`
pushing `changes` to `remote origin`.

`If` you `also` ever `forget` to `make` your `first commit` in your `local` Git
`repository` and `subsequently` check `out` into a `new` feature `branch`,
`follow` the `steps` shown `here`, `and` you `will` have `no` issues
`checking out` into `your` main `branch` and `merging` your `changes` made `in`
the `feature branch`!
