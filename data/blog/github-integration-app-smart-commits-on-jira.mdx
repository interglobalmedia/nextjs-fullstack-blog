I had been away from working on my projects within **Jira** for quite a while, and recently when I got going with various projects again, I started managing my development work within there. But I noticed something very strange. The `#time` command and the `#comment` command worked perfectly, but I couldn't resolve my issues with the `#resolve`, `#done`, or `#close` commands.

I went crazy. I couldn't understand what was going on. Then, when I went in to see what was connected to **Github** with the **Github Integration** app for **Jira**, I saw that certain projects I thought I had connected there were not. But that is not where it ended.

You should make sure that your repositories are all connected to **Jira**. If you want to do that, then you have to make sure that you _**don't**_ **enable** the restriction of your projects when connecting them to the **Github Integration** app. However, if you already have repositories on **Github** that had been created before making this move, you will have to add them manually.

Most important of all, you have to go into your **Git General Settings** in
**Jira** and make sure that you have _**enabled**_ **Send Development
Information to Jira Cloud**, otherwise only the _**default**_ **Jira Smart
Commits and Workflow Triggers** will work _**by default**_. This also means that the `#resolve`, `#done`, and `#close` commands won't work. They are _**not**_ available in **Jira** `smart commits`. _**Only with**_ the **Github Integration** app.

The following is a screenshot of what the **Jira Git General Settings page**
looks like for everyone's edification. I could not find this explanation
anywhere in the **Atlassian Docs**, and hopefully this will help those who are just starting out.

Soon I will discuss how to _**add**_ `SSH` to your **Jira Github Integration**. I will also get into **Jira Automated Workflow Triggers**.
