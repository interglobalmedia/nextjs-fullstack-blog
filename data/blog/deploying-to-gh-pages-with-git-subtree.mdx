**Note 5.21.19:** Some information here might be a bit outdated, but
**_deploying to gh-pages with git subtree_** is not. So I decided to bring this gem back to the blog here.

So I just completed a todo app the other day using `React.` However, I kept on encountering errors in the console using `create-react-app.` Probably some of them were due to errors on my part, but some definitely related to
`create-react-app.` And the thing is, I wasn't able to figure out what the issue was without running the eject command to see what was under the hood. And if I had done that, there was no going back! Well, that just didn't sit well with me. I decided to learn more about `Webpack 2+` so that I could start using the new features it had to offer to create my own `React` workflow, thereby only adding features that I needed. I love creating my own automation processes for my workflows. I have worked hard at creating seamless processes for regular `ES6+ JavaScript` applications using `Gulp, templating engines,` and `Webpack`. Call me nerdy, but I find it a lot of fun and extremely useful! I am yet to take a deep dive into a more complex workflow for `Hugo` (this site is built on it), but that will eventually happen as well.

While on this journey during the advent of `Webpack 2+,` I came across a great course called "Webpack 2: The Complete Developer's Guide" by Stephen Grider on **Udemy**. It didn't cover EVERYTHING, but it definitely provides a solid foundation for getting to know `Webpack 2's` new features. These changes were of course in response to the great overhaul that took place in `JavaScript` with `ES6+`. I was a bit skeptical at first, because I thought that nothing could replace the modularity of the `Gulp` workflow. But, after getting to know `Webpack 2` better, and getting to know `React` a bit, I came to realize that a `Webpack 2+` workflow was much better suited to `React` than a `Gulp` workflow. Developers such as Stephen Grider used to use `Gulp` with `React,` and switched over to exclusively using `Webpack` when **version 2** was introduced. That says something!

So I as I got to know the new `Webpack` and `React` better, I was introduced to new `Git` commands as well. I was introduced to a different and more efficient way of deploying to **Github's** `gh-pages,` which was awesome!

When I had first started using `gh-pages` a few years ago, I would create a
`gh-pages` branch, checkout into it, remove the files and folders I didn't need or that were preventing successful deployment of the project, and then push the project to the remote `gh-pages` branch. Each time I would make a change in my master branch, I would go into the `gh-pages` branch, do a `git rebase master` to incorporate changes made in master into `gh-pages,` and then push those changes to the remote `gh-pages` branch. Then when I started creating much more complex `JavaScript` applications, I found this approach to be cumbersome and a time waster. I looked for alternatives. That's how I got introduced to `Gulp`. When I mastered the `Gulp` workflow using `Webpack` was also when I decided to take on `React.` This was around the time when `Webpack 2` was released. Using `Webpack` without `Gulp` meant tweaking my deployment to `gh-pages.` With `Gulp`, I used the npm package `gulp-gh-pages,` and created a `Gulp` deploy task with `deploy.js.` But when I started using `Webpack` without `Gulp` for my `React` projects, I had to revisit my approach.

After much research and learning, I came across `git subtree.` I have to say, I am really loving it. And it's the fastest deployment process to `gh-pages` I have come across so far!

This is the way it works:

First complete your project so that it's production ready for deployment to your `gh-pages` site.

Next, run the command `git checkout -b gh-pages`. This will create a new branch `gh-pages` and check you out to the new `gh-pages` branch with a single command.

You need to make sure that you push an empty branch to your remote `gh-pages` branch. To achieve that, run the `git rm -rf .` command. `rm` means remove, and `r` stands for recursive. `f` stands for force. And `.` means everything in root. In other words, all your folders in your project and all the files within those folders. Sometimes `rm -r` just doesn't cut it, so you have to run 

```shell
rm -rf .
```

`rm -rf .` gets rid of everything in a single command.

Next you have to stage and then commit those changes. You can stage and commit along with a commit message all in one command:

```shell
git commit -am "First commit to gh-pages branch"
```

The `a` in `am` is short for git add, which stages your changes, and the `m` is short for `git commit -m`. Also, make sure that you remember to have open and closing quotes for your commit message, otherwise you will be held hostage in the **Terminal** window. If by any chance that does happen, you can close your instance of the **Terminal** window with the command `ctrl + c` on your keyboard. It exits the prompt `>` that appears when you haven't added a closing quote. However, `Bash/zsh` does allow you to enter the closing quote after the `>` prompt. Then hit return. To learn more about exiting your git commit message, please visit this **StackOverflow** thread:
[How do I exit my git commit message?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26228848/how-do-i-exit-my-git-commit-message-im-not-in-the-vim-i-used-the-commit-m).

Now you are ready to push these changes to your remote `gh-pages` branch. You can do so with `git push origin gh-pages`.

Next we need to establish our `git subtree` in order for the process to work. We first have to go back into the master branch. We do that by running the command

```shell
git checkout master
```

The great thing about `git subtree` as with `gulp-gh-pages,` is we don't have to be in the `gh-pages` branch in order to deploy to remote! Cool, right? And a big time saver. So our crucial `git` command which we run next is:

```shell
git push origin `git subtree --split --prefix dist gh-pages`:gh-pages --force
```

(A backtick is needed before `git subtree` and after `dist gh-pages`. Due to
markdown, it does not show up here. Please refer to the related articles below for further clarification if necessary.)

Now what does this all mean? First of all, a `git subtree` allows you to insert any repository as a subdirectory of another one. It allows sub-projects to be included within a subdirectory of the main project, optionally including the sub-project's entire history. In our case here, the subdirectory is the `dist` folder being pushed from the master branch to the remote `gh-pages` branch. The sub-projects are the files within the `dist` folder. A `subtree` is simply a subdirectory that can be committed to, branched, and merged along with your project any way you want. That being said, let's look at the rest of the command. We are creating a `git subtree` out of our `dist` folder located in the root of our project, and `--split` does exactly what it sounds like. It is splitting away `dist` from the rest of the project transforming it into a subdirectory. `--prefix dist` means that you are signaling that `dist` is the directory in your project that has been selected as the folder to be made into the subdirectory that is being pushed to the remote `gh-pages` branch. And only
what is contained in that subdirectory will be pushed to `gh-pages`.
`:gh-pages --force` means that you are forcing the push of the `gh-pages` branch to the `remote gh-pages` branch at `origin`.

Since you are likely to make changes to your project in the future and don't
want to continuously write a long command like
`git subtree push --prefix dist origin gh-pages`, you can add a local script in your `package.json.` I created the following:

```shell
"deploy": "npm run build && git subtree push --prefix dist origin gh-pages"
```

I took it up a notch more. I combined my `build script` with my `deploy script.` That way, whenever I make changes to my project, I first run the build command which entails deleting the previous `dist` build, replacing it with the `current` build, and then pushing it to the remote `gh-pages` branch. This ensures that your build is up to date with your latest changes in your project.

So not only has my coding evolved over time, but my devops skills have evolved as well. It reflects the need for greater workflow efficiency with more complex applications.

However, I cannot stress enough the need to understand every single aspect of commands that you implement. You need to know what you are doing, and not
blindly execute commands focusing on the end goal and ignoring the process.
Otherwise, you will not grow as a developer! I also can't emphasize enough how important it is to master `Git` AND to master the `Command Line` in Terminal. `Git` for the distributed version control, and `Command Line` so that you never have to leave the Terminal window. A great time saver. Lastly, practice makes perfect! Or at least ... nearly so!

Happy coding!
