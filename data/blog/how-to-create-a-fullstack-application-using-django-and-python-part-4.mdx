`working knowledge` of `Git`.

## Why this section?

`One thing` that many `fail` to `mention` in `Django Tutorials`,
`development courses`, or `just` in `general`, is the `importance` of
`safeguarding` sensitive `information` that a `site` or `application` depends
`on`. `What` do I `mean` by `that`? Well, most developers `use` the `Git`
version control `system` to track `changes` in the `development` of their
`applications`, and `that` includes `pushing` those `changes` to `potentially`
public `remote repositories` on `Git` hosting `services` such as `Github`.

`Out` of the `box`, `Django` does `include` one `piece` of
`sensitive information` that is `located` in the `Django` project's
`settings.py` file. `And` that `is` the `SECRET_KEY`. `There` is `even` a
`comment` above the `variable` that `states` the `following`:

```python
# SECURITY WARNING: keep the secret key used in production secret!
```

`Very true`, `but` it `should` be `kept secret` period! The `minute` after I
have `created` a `Django` project for a `Django` site, the `settings.py` file is
`created`. That `means` I `have` to `find` a `way` of `safeguarding` the `value`
of the `SECRET_KEY` variable. That's `where` the `python-dotenv` package `comes`
in.

## Adding a .gitignore file to the root directory of the Django site

`After` I `run` the `git init` command to `initialize` a local `Git` repository
`inside` the `root` directory (`/django-boards`) of my `Django` site, I
immediately `create` a file called `.gitignore` inside the `same` root
`directory`, and `add` the `following content`:

```shell
*.log
*.pot
*.pyc
__pycache__ # I actually added this later once this was created
django_boards/__pycache__/ # I actually added this later once this was created
django_boards/boards/__pycache__/ # I actually added this later once this was created
db.sqlite3
.env # relevant to this project security
venv/ # The venv directory should be .gitignored
.venv # The .venv directory should be .gitignored
env/
venv/
ENV/
env.bak/
venv.bak/
.vscode/ # the .vscode directory, if you have one, should be ignored
```

## Making sure the virtual environment is (still) activated

`Next`, I `make sure` that I have `activated` the `virtual environment` from
`inside` the `directory` where the `venv` folder `resides` with the
`following command`:

```shell
source venv/bin/activate
```

I `know` that I `have` successfully `activated` my `virtual environment` if my
`Terminal` command `prompt` looks `something like` the `following`:

```shell
(venv)  mariacam@Marias-MBP  ~/Python-Development/django-boards   main ●
```

## Installing python-dotenv

I `run` the `following command` to install `python-dotenv` from the
`same directory`:

```shell
pip3 install python-dotenv
```

## Importing dotenv into settings.py and configuring it

`In order` for `Django` to `persistently recognize` the `python-dotenv` package,
I `have` to `import` it into `settings.py`, `load it`, `create` a `path` to the
`.env` file `where` the `SECRET_KEY` variable `resides`, `and` then `replace`
the `actual value` of the `SECRET_KEY` with the `SECRET_KEY` variable from the
`.env` file.

`Below` is `how` I import `dotenv` (`that` is the `name` of the `module`),
`take` the `environment variable` from `.env`, `create` a `path` to `it`, and
then `load` it into `settings.py`:

```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv() # take environment variables from .env
dotenv_path = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), '.env')
load_dotenv(dotenv_path)
```

Then I `replace` the `actual value` of `SECRET_KEY` with the `following`:

```python
# SECURITY WARNING: keep the secret key used in production secret!
SECRET_KEY = str(os.getenv('SECRET_KEY'))
```

The `str()` method `transforms` the `value` of the `'SECRET_KEY'` variable to a
`string`.

Inside of the `.env` file, I `add` something `like` the `following`:

```shell
SECRET_KEY=valueoftheSECRET_KEYvariableinsidesettings.py
```

There `should` be `no` space `between` the `=` sign and the `value` of
`SECRET_KEY`, and `no` quotes `added`.

## Adding dotenv to INSTALLED_APPS

The `last step` in the `process` is to `add` the `dotenv` to the
`INSTALLED_APPS` array:

```shell
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    'boards.apps.BoardsConfig',
    'dotenv',
]
```

`Now` I am `ready` to `initialize` a local `Git` repository `inside` my
`django-boards` directory, `commit` my `changes`, and `push` them `to` my remote
`Git` repository on `Github` without `fear` of `exposing` sensitive
`information` there. It is `safely` stored `solely` on my `local machine` inside
an `ignored` .env `file`.
