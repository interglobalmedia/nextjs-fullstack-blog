**_Recently_** I was **_getting_** `mdx Eslint linting errors` in my `mdx files` where I **_write_** my **_posts_**. And a `red squiggly line` **_appears_** at the `top` of my `mdx files` where I had the **_starting_** `—--` **_triple hyphens_** which **_indicate_** the `start` of the `frontmatter data block` of the `file`. I **_needed_** to let `ESLint` **_know_** of such `mdx frontmatter syntax` so that it would **_not throw_** a `linting error`, thereby **_resulting_** in a `commit failure`.

**_After_** a **_bit_** of **_research_**, I **_came across_** an `issue` on the `eslint-mdx` **_Github repository_** which **_provided_** the `configuration` I **_need_** to **_add_** to my `.eslintrc.js file`:

```js
module.exports = {
	extends: [
		'eslint:recommended',
		'plugin:mdx/recommended',
		'plugin:prettier/recommended',
		'next',
		'next/core-web-vitals',
	],

	settings: {
		'mdx/code-blocks': true,
		'mdx/language-mapper': {},
	},
}
```

In the `extends array`, I added `'plugin:mdx/recommended'`, **_because_** I
**_wanted_** `ESLint` to **_recognize_** that I **_do indeed_** have
`eslint-plugin-mdx npm` package **_installed_**. And I **_added_** the
`settings object` **_because_** I **_wanted_** to `lint code blocks` at the
**_same time_** (optional) by **_adding_** `'mdx/code-blocks': true`. And for the **_sake_** of **_future potential additions_** or **_overrides_**, I
**_added_** `'mdx/language-mapper': {}` **_where_** I could **_disable_** the `language mapper` **_inside_** the `mapper object`. And in my `next.config.js` file, I **_already_** had **_added_**:

```js
module.exports = withBundleAnalyzer({
	pageExtensions: ['js', 'jsx', 'md', 'mdx'],
})
```

**_Now_**, when I `git commit` my **_changes_**, I **_don’t get_** a
`linting error` because of the **_unrecognized frontmatter_** `---` **_data
definition_** in my `post files` **_due to_** my `husky pre-commit hook`
**_associated with_** my lint-staged configuration, which then meant that I
would be able to achieve a **_successful commit_**.

To **_recap_**, `ESLint` is a `parser` for **_inspecting code_**, **_reporting bugs_**, **_coding mistakes_**, or **_typos_**. It is **_opinionated_**, so **_sometimes_** we **_have_** to **_disable rules_** in **_order_** to **_be able_** to **_make commits_**.

`lint-staged` is a `package` **_used_** to **_run_** a `linter` (in **_this
case_** `ESLInt` and `Prettier`) on `staged git files` and **_prevent them_** from **_committing_** `buggy code`.

`Husky`, as mentioned in **_other posts_** here (you can look up `“Husky”` in the `Tags page`), is a `tool` that **_works_** with `Git hooks` such as the `pre-commit hook`.

`Prettier` is a `tool` for **_formatting code_** based on its `configuration` **_defined_** in its `config file` (mine is called `prettier.config.js`, but it can **_also be_** a `json file` called `.prettierrc.json`).

**_Happy linting_** and **_successful pre-committing!_**

**Note 12.9.22**: The `red squiggly line` **_still shows up_** at the
**_beginning_** of the beginning of the frontmatter data block represented by the `---` triple hyphens, but as mentioned in an `esint-plugin-markdown` issue **_entitled_** [ Parsing error: Invalid left-hand side in prefix operation in mdx frontmatter #150](https://github.com/eslint/eslint-plugin-markdown/issues/150) on their `Github repository`,

> That parse error suggests that it's trying to parse the --- in the first line of the file as a -- prefix unary decrement operator. That normally wouldn't happen. Is there something in your config that might cause ESLint to parse a .mdx file as JS?
>
> I explained a bit in [MDX support #134 (comment)](https://github.com/eslint/eslint-plugin-markdown/issues/134#issuecomment-662231531),
but I don't expect this plugin would work with MDX syntax currently since it's so different from Markdown. Based on a skim of the MDX docs, it shouldn't crash on the syntax, and in fact it shouldn't do anything. The plugin works by looking for ```js fenced code blocks, and since MDX doesn't need those, it shouldn't find any code to pass to ESLint in the first place. My guess is it should treat all the embedded JSX as regular text and ignore it like it ignores all the rest of the file outside of fenced code blocks.

> You're probably **_best using_** [https://github.com/mdx-js/eslint-mdx](https://github.com/mdx-js/eslint-mdx) to lint `.mdx files` since it's **_maintained_** by the `MDX team`. - ***btmills commented on Jul 22, 2020***

And **_because_** of the line `'mdx/code-blocks': true,` in the
`ESLint config file`, `Eslint` **_lints_** `code blocks` in my **_posts_**. So they **_literally_** have to be `error free`! **_Which is_** actually **_really good_**!
