I `just` finished `creating` a `cron job` that `backs up` my `Desktop` directory
`daily` in my `Linux Mint OS`. The `name` of the `backup` includes the `date`
and `time` of the backup.

## Creating the desktop-backup directory and the desktop_backup.sh shell script

`First`, I `created` a `backup directory` called `desktop-backups` in my
`home directory` (`/home/maria`), and then I `created` a `shell script` called
`desktop_backup.sh` located in `/home/maria/Desktop/cron-job-scripts/`. And then
I added the following:

```shell
#!/bin/bash

source_dir="/home/maria/Desktop"
backup_dir="/home/maria/desktop-backup"
timestamp=$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S)
backup_file="backup_$timestamp.tar.gz"
tar -czvf "$backup_dir/$backup_file" "$source_dir"
```

The `first line` in the `script` is `very important`. `#!` is referred to as
`shebang`, and it `tells` the `system` which `interpreter/command` to `use` to
`execute` the `commands` written `inside` the `scripts`. The `interpreter` here
is `bash`, and the `path` to it is `/bin/bash`, which follows `#!`. `#!` is
`interpreted` by the [execve(2)](https://linux.die.net/man/2/execve) system call
(which `executes` programs).

`Next`, and `most important`, is to `change` file `permissions` for the
`desktop_backup.sh` file. `By default`, a `newly` created `file` does` not`
contain `execute permissions`, which is `necessary` for `executing` shell script
`files`. So next, I have to `run` the `following` in `Terminal` to add
`execute permissions` to `desktop_backup.sh` from `inside` the `directory` where
it `resides`:

````shell
chmod +x desktop_backup.sh
```

`chmod` stands for `change mode`.

Then I `check` to `make sure` that `execute permissions` were `added` to `desktop_backup.sh` by running the `ls -l` command in `Terminal`, and the `following` is `returned` as a `result`:

```shell
-rwxrwxr-x 1 maria maria 208 Aug 7 13:10 desktop_backup.sh
```

When I `create` the `delete_backups.sh` file (coming up), I will have to `change permissions` in the `same way` as well.

If I run `date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S` in `Terminal`, `something like` the `following` is
`returned`:

```shell
202400807161028
````

`202400807` is the `year`, `month` and `day`. `161028` is the `hour`, `minutes`,
and `seconds` in `24 hour format`. `After` I `run` the `shell script`,
`something like` the `following` appears in the `desktop-backup` directory:

```shell
backup_202400807161028.tar.gz
```

If I am `inside` the `cron-job-scripts` directory where `desktop_backup.sh`
resides, I `run` the `following` in `Terminal`:

```Shell
./desktop_backup.sh
```

Which is `how` a `shell script` is `run` in `Terminal`. If I am `not inside` the
`directory` which `contains` the `shell script`, then I have to `add` the `path`
to it. `./` means `that` it `is` in the `current directory`.

## Creating the delete_backups.sh shell script

But `after` a `while`, `a lot` of `backups` will `take up` the `desktop-backup`
directory, and I probably would `want` to remove `older backups`. I can `create`
a `separate script` for `that`.

I could `create` another `shell script` to `remove` older `backups`:

```shell
#!/bin/bash

find /home/maria/desktop-backup/* -type f -mtime +1 -delete
```

The `find` command `looks` for `files` in a `directory hierarchy`. In the
`script` above, it is `searching` for the `files` located in
`/home/maria/desktop-backup/`, and the wildcard `*` means `anything`
(`any file`) inside `/home/maria/desktop-backup/`. `-type f` means of
`type file`. `-mtime` is `interpreted` as the `number` of `whole days` in the
`age` of a `file`. And `-mtime +n` (in `this` case `+1`) means `greater than n`
(`whole`) days. `-delete` deletes what is `inside` the
`/home/maria/desktop-backup/` directory.

## Adding the shell scripts to the crontab file

After I `created` these `two` shell `scripts`, I `added` them to my `crontab`
file.

`First`, I ran `crontab -e` in 1. It `took` me `into` the `crontab` file, where
I `added` my `cron jobs`. Then I `added` the `following` to the `bottom` of the
`file` below all the `commented lines`:

```shell
00 06 * * * /home/maria/Desktop/cron-job-scripts/desktop_backup.sh
05 06 * * * /home/maria/Desktop/cron-job-scripts/delete_backups.sh
```

The `meaning` of the `first line` is that the `cron job` will `take place` at
`6am` every `day`. The `meaning` of the `second` cron job is that it will
`take place` at `6:05am` every `day`. The `*` in the `day position` which
`follows` the `hour position`, `means` every `day`. The next `*` to the `right`
is in the `month position` and `means` every `month`. And the last `*` (`to` the
`right`) which `represents` the `day` of the `week`, means `every day `of the
`week`.

`Since` I `just` set `up` this `cron job` today, I will probably `not reap` its
`benefits` until the `day` after `tomorrow`. I will `update` this `post` with
the `results` when the `contents` of the `desktop-backup` is `deleted`!
