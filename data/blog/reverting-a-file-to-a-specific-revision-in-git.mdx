Sometimes when you are working on an application using `Git`, you made a
**change** to a **_specific_** **file**, **committed** it, and then **pushed**
the **commit** to `remote`. But **_later_**, you **decided** that you **wanted** to **_bring back_** that **file** to the `state` **previous** to that **change** you **made**. In **_other_** **words**, perhaps you **want** to **_re-insert_** the `code` that you had **removed**, for **_instance_**.

**That** is **exactly** what **happened** with **me** a little while ago. I
found that I **_still_** **needed** the `code` I had **removed** from a file,
and **wanted** to `revert` to the **file state** which still **contained** that `code`. It's very **simple** really, especially if a **_particular_** **commit** only **involved** that **_one_** **file**. This is the `command` I **executed** to `revert` to the **file state** that **contained** the `code` I **wanted** to **bring back**:

```shell
git checkout cf0d404 src/index.js
```

What I am doing here is **checking out** into a **_specific_** `commit` with the **hash** `cf0d404`, and **_specifically_** into the **file path** `src/index.js` that I **want** to **restore**. When I hit `return`, I **see** that the **file** has indeed **reverted** to the `state` I **want**. Then, when I **execute** the `Git` **command**:

```shell
git status
```

The **_following_** is **returned** in `Terminal`:

```shell
git status                                                                                  âœš
On branch handling-express-errors
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
        modified:   src/index.js
```

**Since** I **_do_** **want** this **change** to **remain** `staged` and
actually `commit` it, I simply **execute** the **command** `git commit`,
**create** and **save** my `commit` **message**, and then `return` to `Terminal` from `VIM`.

And that is it!
