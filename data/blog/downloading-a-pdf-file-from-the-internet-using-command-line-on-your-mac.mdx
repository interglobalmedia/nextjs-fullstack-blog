***Since*** I have ***already written*** a [post](/posts/compressing-and-uncompressing-directories-from-the-command-line/) about `zipping` and `unzipping` ***directories*** on a `Mac` ***using*** the `Command Line`, I thought I would ***take*** that ***track*** a ***step further*** by `talking about` ***how*** to `download` a `pdf` ***file*** from the `internet` ***using*** the `Command Line` on your `Mac`. I will ***also discuss*** where it ***ends up*** ***relative*** to ***where*** you ***are***.

I will ***use*** a ***simple example*** that I ***actually learned*** from to ***demonstrate*** this. If there is a ***specific*** `pdf` ***file*** you ***want*** to `download`, please feel free to ***replace*** my `web address` and `filename` with ***yours***.

The ***following*** `command` in `Terminal` (`iTerm2`) will **_download_** the
`pdf` ***file*** called `sample.pdf` from the `website` http://www.blazemonger.com/:

```shell
curl -O http://www.blazemonger.com/sample.pdf
```

the `-O` **option** consists of an `alphabetical capital O` and **_not_** a
`zero`.

This `command` **_downloads_** the `file` into the `directory` you are
**currently in_**. So if you ***are on*** your `desktop` via `Command Line`, it
will **_download_** the `file` **_there_**. If you ***are in*** one of your
`project` ***root directories***, it will `download` it **_there_**. If you ***are
in*** a `subdirectory` of one of your `project` ***directories***, it will
`download` it **_there_**. So ***be aware*** of ***where*** you ***currently are*** on your
`computer`! You can ***check this*** by `typing` the `pwd` ***command*** in your
`Terminal` **_before_** you ***execute*** the `curl -O` ***command***. This
**_ensures_** that you are ***already*** in the `directory` ***where*** you ***want*** to
***include*** the `pdf`!

*Happy pdf downloading!*
