## Getting a custom domain

`In order` to `set up` a `backend` email `service` with `Django Boards`, I first
`had` to `purchase` a `domain`. I purchased `djangoboards.org` on `Namecheap`.
`Then` I `added it` to my `Mailtrap` account `when` it `prompted me` for my
`application`'s `domain`.

### Connecting the custom domain to Render

`Next`, I `had` to `connect` my `custom domain` to `Render`. `To` do `that`, I
`went` into my `django-boards` web service `settings` and `scrolled down` to
`"Custom Domains"`. `Then` I `clicked` on `"Add Custom Domain"` and `followed`
the `prompts`.

`When` my `domain` was `verified`, `Render` returned `"verified"`, but `also`
returned `"Certificate pending"`. `I` contacted `Namecheap support` to
`determine` next `steps`. Their `live` chat `support` takes `5-10 minutes` to
`get back` with `answers`. They `explained` where the `certificate` came `from`
and `that` they `had` nothing to do `with` it. `It` was a `Render certificate`.
I `went back` to my `django-boards` web service `Settings` and `refreshed` the
`page`. `"Certificate Issued"` appeared.

`When` I `checked` my `application`'s `web address`, both
`django-boards.onrender.com` and `www.djangoboards.org` were `available`.

`However`, there `was` one `more` thing to `do`. I `had` to `add` my
`custom domain` to my `ALLOWED_HOSTS` and `push` that `change` to `remote`! I
`added` both `djangoboards.org` and `www.djangoboards.org`. I `added` these
`values` to `my` environment `variable` called `ALLOWED_HOSTS` within
`Environment` in my `django-boards` web `service`. You `can` also `add it` to
your `ALLOWED_HOSTS` in `.env` as `well`. I `did`.

`After` my `variable` was `updated`, my `build` and `deployment` completed, I
`clicked` on my `custom domain` again. `This time` it `worked`!

`Namecheap` is a `great place` to `purchase domains`. Their `prices` are
`very competitive`, and `their support` is `really great`. If you `decide` to
`take` that `route`, please visit `Render`'s
[Configuring Namecheap DNS](https://render.com/docs/configure-namecheap-dns). It
`takes` no `time` to `set up`.

### Configuring Domain Verification with Namecheap for Mailtrap

`Mailtrap` provided `me` with `documentation` entitled
[Domain Verification with Namecheap](https://help.mailtrap.io/article/128-domain-verification-with-namecheap?_gl=1*ck1two*_gcl_au*NDAxNDk2MzYwLjE3MzU3OTY0MDA.),
`and` I `followed` the `steps` to `verification` there:

1. I `went` into my `Namecheap dashboard` and `clicked` on djangoboards.org's
   `Manage button`.
1. I `navigated` to the `Advanced` DNS `tab`.
1. I `clicked` on `Add New Record`.
1. I `returned` to `Mailtrap`. On the `Domain` Verification `page`, I
   `looked for` the `DNS records` I `needed` to `add` to `Namecheap`. `These`
   are `Domain Verification`, `DKIM`, `SPF`, `DMARC`, and `Domain Tracking`. I
   `needed` the `values` under `Type`, `Name`, and `Value`.

`Domain Verification`, `DKIM`, and `Domain tracking` are `CNAME` records. `SPF`
and `DMARC` are `TXT` records.

1. `Domain Verification` proves `that` I `own` the `domain`.
1. `DKIM` verifies `that` emails are `sent` from my `domain`.
1. `SPF` authorizes the `Mailtrap` server to `send` my `emails`.
1. `DMARC` tells `email servers` what `to do` when `DKIM` or `SPF` fails.

I `have` been `verified` on Mailtrap, `but` only `have access` to
`Email Testing` at `this time` because my `compliance check` is not `complete`.
`Mailtrap` "needs to perform additional checks on this domain". This can take up
to one business day." `It` has `been` more `than` one `day` that I `have` not
`heard` from `them` (`1.5.25`). `With` all the `bad actors` on the `internet`,
`it` has `become` very `difficult` for `developers` to create
`realtime applications` towards their `"dynamic" portfolios`.

`However`, I am `writing` a `post` regarding `Mailtrap` email `testing`. It
`will be` published `soon`!

`In` the `meantime`, `I` am `further investigating` email `backend services`
(including `Mailgun`).

## Adding a new app called faqs

I also `added` a `new app` called `faqs` where `commonly` asked `questions` are
`answered`. `I` just `had` to `make sure` that I `commented out` my
`production database` and `uncommented` my `development database`. Then, `once`
everything `worked well` in `development`, I just `had` to `recreate` the
`content` in `production`.

The `command` for `creating` the `faqs` app:

```shell
python3 manage.py startapp faqs
```

### Creating the models for faqs

```python
# faqs/models.py
from django.db import models

# Create your models here.
class FAQ(models.Model):
    question = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    answer = models.TextField()

    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.question} {self.answer}"
```

`At first` I `thought` it would be `great` to `have` a `bit` of `HTML` which I
would `create` in the `Django admin` and then `apply` the `safe` template
`filter` which would `tell` the `template engine` that the `output` of
`faq.question` and `faq.answer` is `safe` to `display` as `HTML` without
`escaping`. `But` then I `thought better` of `it`, and `removed` all `HTML`. `I`
`had been` using `<br>` tags `to` create `linebreaks`, but `then` I
`came across` the `template filter` called `linebreaksbr`. It `replaced` all the
`<br>` tags I `had` been `using`, `and` `I removed` the `one` anchor `element` I
had `added`. I `decided` to just `add` plain `text`. `Much safer` that `way`! I
couldn't `use` the `nh3` sanitization `configuration` I had `created` for my
`board topics` markdown, `because` that `involved` actual `forms` on the
`front end`. `That` is not `how` I configured `faqs.question` and `faqs.answer`.
There `were` no `forms` for `them` on the `front end`.

### Creating the view for faqs

`Next`, I `created` a simple `view` for the `faqs` app. It is the `following`:

```python
# faqs/views.py
from django.shortcuts import render
from .models import FAQ

# Create your views here.

def faqs_view(request):
    faqs = FAQ.objects.all()
    return render(request, 'faqs/faqs.html', {'faqs': faqs})
```

### Creating a URLconf for the faqs_index view

`Next`, I `created` a `URLconf` for the `faqs_index` view in `faqs/urls.py`;

```python
# faqs/urls.py
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('faqs/', views.faqs_view, name='faqs_index'),
]
```

`In order` to access `faqs_view` in a `browser`, we `need` to `map it` to a
`URL`. `In order` to `map it` to a `URL`, we `need` to `define` a
`URL configuration` or `URLconf` for `short` inside `polls/urls.py`. `URLconfs`
are `defined` in each `Django` project `app` in `urls.py`. `Note` that `when` we
`create` an `app`, `it` does `not` come `with` a `urls.py` file. We `have` to
`create` one.

### Configuring the global URL configuration for faqs_index view in django_boards/urls.py

`Next`, I `had` to `configure` the `global` URL `conf` defined in
`django_boards/urls.py`. `To` do `this`, I `added` the `following`:

```python
# django_boards/urls.py
urlpatterns = [
    ...
    path("", include('faqs.urls')),
    ...
]
```

We `define` our `faqs-specific` URLs in `faqs/urls.py`, `and` then `just` add
`path("", include('faqs.urls')),` as `indicated` above.

The `include()` function `lets` us `reference` other `URLconfs`. `include()`
excludes the `part` of the `URL` that `follows` the `matched part`, i.e.,
`faqs/`, and `sends` the `remaining string` to `the` included `URLconf` for
`further processing`. `In` my `case` here, all `faqs/` related `URLconfs` are
`sent` to `django_boards/urls.py` for `further processing`. `This` approach
`organizes` URLs `by app`, `and` also `makes` the global `urls.py` in our
`Django project` much `easier` to `read`.

## Migrating faqs

`Since` I `had` created/made `changes` to my `faqs` model, I `had` to `run` a
`migration` on `faqs`. `I` also `had` to `make sure` that `I` was in
`development` mode. I `had` to `comment out` my `production database` in
`django_boards/settings/production.py` and `uncomment` my `development database`
in `django_boards/settings/development.py`. `Then` I `ran` the
`following commands`:

```shell
python3 manage.py makemigrations faqs
python3 manage.py migrate faqs
```

## Making the faqs app modifiable in the admin interface

`Next`, I `had` to `register` the `fags app` so `that` it `would` be
`modifiable` in the `admin interface`. I `added` the `following` to
`faqs/admin.py`:

```python
from django.contrib import admin
from .models import FAQ

# Register your models here.
admin.site.register(FAQ)
```

`Now` the `FAQS` app `appeared` in the `Django Boards` admin `along` with
`Accounts` and `Boards`. This `meant` that `now` I could `add` my FAQs
`questions` and `answers` from the `admin` as I `wanted`.

## Conclusion

In this section, I got a custom domain for my Django Boards application from
Namecheap, connected the custom domain to Render, configured domain verification
with Namecheap for Mailtrap backend email service, added a new app called faqs,
created the models for faqs, created a view for faqs, created a URLconf for the
faqs_index view, configured the global URL configuration for faqs_index view in
django_boards/urls.py, migrated faqs, and made the faqs app modifiable in the
admin interface.
