In order to understand what `redirect operators` do in `Linux` or `Unix`
(`macOS`), one first has to understand what `stdin` and `stdout` mean.

In the case of a personal `Linux` (or `macOS`) device, for example, **_by
default_**, `stdin` refers to a device's `keyboard`, and `stdout` refers to
`Command Line` (`Terminal`). And these `pathways` are called `streams`.

That being said, we don't always want to output `stdout` to `Command Line`,
which is not persistent by default. Perhaps we want to save it somewhere. It is
possible to change our `default input` and `output` locations. This means making
the OS to obtain information from somewhere other than the `stdin` or send
results to somewhere other than the `stdout`. This functionality is known as
`redirection`.

## The output redirector operator (`>`)

The default `output redirector operator` is the most popular and well known of
`redirectors`. As previously mentioned, by default, when not using
`redirection`, `stdout` is made in `Terminal`. However, this `output` is not
persistent because it is not saved to `Terminal`! If it was, we would have an
awful lot of clutter there!

In `Linux Command Line`, if I were to run the following in `Terminal`:

```shell
$HOME
```

the following would be returned in `Terminal`:

```shell
bash: /home/maria: Is a directory
```

I type `$HOME` with my `laptop keyboard`, my `stdin`, and it is output to the
`Terminal window`, my `stdout`. But it is not saved anywhere, so I can't refer
to that particular output later. But as also previously mentioned, I can
`redirect` this `output` somewhere else, and even `save` the `data` using the
`output redirector` (`>`). So let's say I run the following command instead:

```shell
printenv 'HOME' > home.txt
```

Then, if I use the `cat` command to output the contents of `home.txt`:

```shell
cat home.txt
```

It results in the following `output` in `Terminal`:

```shell
/home/maria
```

However, if I simply ran the following without using the
`output redirector operator`:

```shell
printenv 'HOME'
```

the following would be returned in `Terminal`:

```shell
/home/maria
```

And `/home/maria` would not be `redirected` and `output` to `home.txt`.

The `printenv` command prints the value of an `environment variable`, and
`$HOME` is one of them. In this case, `printenv` is printing the value of the
`global environment variable` called `'HOME'`. And since I am not appending `$`
to the beginning of `HOME`, it is not being treated as a `variable` containing a
`value` (HOME=/home/maria), but simply as the `value` of `$HOME`.

## The input redirector operator (`<`)

The `default input redirector` (`<`) redirects `stdin` somewhere else. For
example, if I type the following in `Terminal` followed by the `Return`
(`Enter`) key:

```shell
printenv 'HOME' < home.txt
```

this would result in the following in `Terminal`:

```shell
/home/maria
```

And if I open up `home.txt` with the `vim` command:

```shell
vim home.txt
```

The following would appear:

```shell
/home/maria
```

If I were to combine the `input` and `output` operator, for example:

```shell
printenv 'HOME' < home.txt > home2.txt
```

This command both redirects `stdin` and `stdout`, and also creates a new file
called `home2.txt` if it does not already exist, thanks to the `output operator`
(`>`).

When I run the following in `Terminal`:

```shell
cat home2.txt
```

it returns the following in `Terminal`:

```shell
/home/maria
```

When I run the following in `Terminal`:

```shell
cat home.txt
```

it returns the following:

```shell
/home/maria
```

However, because I am using the (single) `regular output operator` (`>`), it
`overwrites` the previous content of `home2.txt` with a new instance of
`/home/maria`. What if I `didn't want` to `overwrite` the contents of
`home2.txt`?

## The output redirector append operator (`>>`)

If I just want to `append` the `contents` of `stdin` (i.e., `home.txt`) to
`stdout` (i.e., `home2.txt`), I would run the following in `Terminal`:

```shell
printenv 'HOME' < home.txt >> home2.txt
```

Then, when I run the following command in `Terminal`:

```shell
cat home2.txt
```

it returns the following in `Terminal`:

```shell
/home/maria
/home/maria
```

And if I run the following in `Terminal`:

```shell
cat home.txt
```

it returns the following in `Terminal`:

```shell
/home/maria
```

The `contents` of `home.txt` remains the same because it is the `stdin`, but
`home2.txt` now `includes` a `second line` of `text`, which has been `appended`
to the `original` first line of `text`. `No data` was `overwritten` or `lost`.

**An important thing to note**: Usually one should use the
`output redirector append operator` (`>>`) instead of the
`output redirector operator` (`>`) so as not to lose any file data (unless there
is a specific reason to use `>`)!
