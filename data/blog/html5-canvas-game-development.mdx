***Canvas 2D Breakout Game***

I ***just finished*** `developing` a `2D Breakout Game` ***using*** `HTML5 Canvas`. I ***added*** a `workflow` to it (of course) for ***testing*** in `Command Line` ***purposes***, for ***speeding up*** the `development proces`s, and ***speeding up*** the ***process*** of ****making**** `files production ready`. ***One thing*** I ***learned*** first and foremost: `HTML5 Canvas games` are `data-consumption` ***expensive***! By **_removing_** a **few things** from the `workflow` like `normalize.css` and `postcss-mixins` ***npm plugin***, as ***well***
as `minifying code`, I ***was able*** to **_reduce_** the `JS heap` **_by over_** `10mb`. **_However_**, the `range` ***still*** ended up ***being*** between `16mb and 42mb`. ***Every time*** the `game` ***_restarts_***, the `heap` is `cleared` **_right beforehand_**. This is ***good*** of course, ***but*** the ***question is***: ***does*** a `user` ***want*** to `consume` ***up to*** `42mb` of ***his/her*** `mobile data`? ***At home***, via ***some kind*** of ***paid*** `internet service` ***where*** `total data consumption` does ***not matter*** is ***one thing***, but `mobile consumption` can ***matter very much*** on ***the go*** when `data caps` ***do matter***.

I ***decided not*** to ***take on*** this `project` ***taking*** `web performance` ***into consideration***. I just ***wanted*** to become ***more familiar*** with `game development` and
`drawing graphics` ***with*** `HTML`, `CSS`, and `JavaScript`. And ***I did***. It was a ***very interesting*** `learning experience`, and `one which` ***made me*** even ***more familiar*** with the `JS Console` and ***how*** to `optimize` the `web performance` of `my project`. To ***view***
this ***project*** on `Githubâ€™s gh-pages`, ***please visit***
