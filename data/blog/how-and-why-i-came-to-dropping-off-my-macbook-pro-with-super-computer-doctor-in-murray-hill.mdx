**_Yesterday_**, as I was **_putting_** my `laptop` into my **_computer bag_**, I **_noticed_** that the **_back_** of it was **_starting_** to **_separate_**. In **_other words_**, it was **_becoming loose_**. I was **_very concerned_**, and **_decided_** to **_re-visit_** the
[Murray Hill Neighborhood Association website](https://www.murrayhillnyc.org/) to **_check out_** `information` about a **_computer repair business_** in the **_neighborhood_** called `Super Computer Doctor`. Maybe **_they_** would **_be able_** to **_fix_** the **_issue_**?

**_After_** my `class` and `office hour` were over, I **_called_** the
`Super Computer Doctor` **_number_**, and **_someone_** `answered`. I
**_explained_** that the **_back_** of my `MacBook Pro `was **_starting_** to **_separate_** from the **_rest_** of the `laptop`, and would they be **_able_** to **_tighten_** it? I said I could **_come over_** the **_following morning_** (**_today_**), and **_could_** they **_please_** take care of it `ASAP`, as I **_needed_** it **_back immediately_**.

I **_arrived_** at the **_building_** where the `business` **_resides_**, and `Lance`, my **_technician_**, came down **_promptly_** at `9am`. Then I
**_showed him_** the **_back_** of my `laptop`. I **_fiddled_** with the
**_back_** a **_little_** to **_show_** where I **_thought_** the **_issue
was_**, and then he **_took_** a **_look_**. After **_looking_** at it, he
**_stated_** that he **_didn’t think_** there were **_any screws_** there. I was **_like_**, “**_Really_**? That is **_NOT possible_**.”

He **_said_** he would **_take up_** the `laptop` and **_examine_** the
**_situation_** more **_carefully_**. After a **_few minutes_**, he **_texted me_** stating

> Super computer doctor: We are working on your computer now. Eight screws are missing so there will be an extra charge.

I **_replied_**

> No problem. I figured as much. From now on. I learned a lesson to take
pictures if my computer when it is new for reference. One forgets details
sometimes! I knee back then there was something odd. Thanks!

I **_had thought_** when I **_went_** to **_get_** the `laptop` **_fixed_** at the [iStore](<[iStore](https://istorestm.com/istore-new-york/)>) because of a `battery swell` and the **_need_** for a **_new battery_**, that **_when_** I **_got_** it **_back_**, the `screws` **_seemed_** so **_recessed_**. Well, it **_ends up_** that there were **_no screws_**! It **_never entered_** my **_mind_** that a **_business_** would just NOT **_put in_** the **_screws_** (**_literally_**).

After a **_few_** more **_minutes_**, `Lance`, my **_technician_**, **_came
down_** with the `laptop`, and the `back` **_looked_** as **_brand new_** again. What a **_life saver_**! If I had **_waited_** any **_longer_**, I would have had a **_completely separated_** `laptop` **_back_**. And **_that_** would NOT have been **_good_**!

But **_how_** did I **_come_** to **_learn about_**
[Super Computer Doctor](https://www.murrayhillnyc.org/common/directory/directory-profile.cfm?QID=79602&clientID=11037&ThisPage=directory),
you **_may ask_**.

On a **_recent_** `Sunday`, when I **_went_** to my **_local_** `Church`, The `Church of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary`, on `33rd Street` **_between_** `1st and 2nd` **_Avenues_**, I **_received_** a **_weekly bulletin_** that **_contained_** some **_information_** regarding **_local businesses_** and **_organizations_** in the **_neighborhood_**. **_One_** of **_them_** was the [Murray Hill Neighborhood Association](https://www.murrayhillnyc.org/). And they were **_looking_** for **_Trustees_**. I **_thought_** it could be **_interesting_** to **_become_** one, since I had **_grown up_** in the **_neighborhood_** and **_wanted_** to **_see_** it **_flourish_** (**_again_**), so I **_contacted_** them.

Well, I **_didn’t_** end up **_becoming_** a `Trustee` (for **_now_** anyway), but I **_did_** become a **_small business member_**. **_After_** I had **_joined_**, I **_went_** on the [website](https://www.murrayhillnyc.org/) and **_found_** [Super Computer Doctor](https://www.murrayhillnyc.org/common/directory/directory-profile.cfm?QID=79602&clientID=11037&ThisPage=directory). And I **_thought_**, I **_might_** actually **_need_** these guys **_some day_**. I **_didn’t speak_** too **_soon_**. I **_ended_** up **_needing them_** several days later!

For **_anyone reading_** this **_post_** who **_happens_** to **_be_** in the `Kips Bay/Murray Hill` **_neighborhood_**, I **_highly encourage_** `becoming` a **_member_** of this `not-for-profit` **_organization_**! To **_learn more_**, you can **_visit_** their [website](https://www.murrayhillnyc.org/common/11037/default.cfm?clientID=11037&ThisPage=Home).
And to **_learn more_** about `Super Computer Doctor`, you can **_visit_** their **_listing_** on the `Association`’s **_website_** under
[Members > Business > Computers > Professional Services >](https://www.murrayhillnyc.org/common/directory/directory-profile.cfm?QID=79602&clientID=11037&ThisPage=directory). I will **_definitely_** be a **_repeat customer_** when the **_opportunity_** presents itself **_again_**!
