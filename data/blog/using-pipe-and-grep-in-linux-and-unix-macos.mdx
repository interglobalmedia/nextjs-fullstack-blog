The `pipe` command, `|`, aka `un-named pipe`, transmits the output of one
command to another command. It can redirect `stdout`, `stdin`, or `stderr` of
`one process` to `another` for `further processing`.

The `grep` command, short for `global regular expression print`, is used for
`searching` and `manipulating` **_text patterns_** in `files`.

## The un-named pipe (`|`) command in Linux

A basic use of the `un-named pipe` (`|`) is the following:

```shell
ls -la /etc | less
```

If I ran this command in `Terminal`, I would get the complete listing of the
contents in the `/etc` folder in `Linux`, including `dot` (`.`) hidden files
thanks to the `-a` flag which includes `hidden files`, and the long list of the
contents inside `/etc` represented by the `-l` flag. `-la` is just short for
`-l` and `-a` together.

`Long list` (`-l`) returns `file permissions`, the `number` of `links`,
`owner name`, `owner group`, `file size`, `time of last modification`, and the
`file` or `directory name`. To learn more, run `man ls` in `Terminal`.

After `ls -la /etc`, comes pipe (`|`) followed by `less`. The pipe command
transmits `ls -la /etc` to the `less` command. The `less` command is a
`Terminal` pager program used to `view` the `contents` of a `text file` one
`Terminal screen` (`window`) at a time. This is great for `scrolling through`
very `long files`. You just `use` the `up` or d`own` arrow keys to
`scroll through` the `file contents`.

So what the above command means is that the `less` command is being `applied` to
the `ls -la /etc` command, which makes it possible to `scroll through` the
contents of `/etc` with the `up` or `down` arrow keys. If I simply used
`ls -la /etc`, I `would` only `see` the `end screen` of the `contents` of
`/etc`. I would not be able to scroll up to see the rest of it.

## The grep command

A `basic use` of the `grep` command would be something like the following:

```shell
grep "Doe" names2.txt
```

where the `contents` of `names2.txt` is the following:

```shell
1 Doe
2 Doe
3 Sue
```

`grep "Doe" names2.txt` returns the following in `Terminal`:

```shell
1 Doe
2 Doe
```

If I ran the following command in `Terminal`:

```shell
grep -c "Doe" names2.txt
```

the following would be returned in `Terminal`:

```shell
2
```

The `-c` flag `prints` the `count` of `matching lines` for each `grep search`.
In this case, there are `two instances`, each on a different line, of `"Doe"`.

If I were to run the following in `Terminal`:

```shell
grep -v "Doe" names2.txt
```

it would return the following:

```shell
3 Sue
```

The `-v` flag, or `--invert-match`, selects `non-matching lines`. In this case,
It is `Sue` on line 3.

Let's say I ran the following in `Terminal`:

```shell
grep -i "doe" names2.txt
```

It would return the following:

```shell
1 Doe
2 Doe
```

The `-i` flag, or `--ignore-case`, ignores whether the text pattern being
searched is upper or lowercase, so that's why when **_searching_** `"doe"` I am
able to get back `"Doe`".

If I run the following command `Terminal`:

```shell
grep -L "John" *
```

it would return the following:

```shell
duplicates.txt
names2.txt
```

The `L` flag, short for `--file-without-match`, returns the files in the current
directory that do NOT contain the text pattern `"John"`.

But if I ran the following in `Terminal`:

```shell
grep -l "John" *
```

It would return the following:

```shell
names1.txt
```

The `-l` flag, short for `--files-with-matches`, returns the files that `Do`
contain the `text pattern` being `searched` in the `current working directory`.
In this case, `"John"`.

`"John"` followed by `*` or the `wildcard character`, is telling `grep` to
search through all the files in the `current working directory`.

There is much more to `grep`, and you can learn more by running `man grep` in
`Terminal` to access the `grep manual`.

## Combining `pipe` (`|`) with `grep`

`pipe` (`|`) and
`grep are frequently used together. Let's say I run the following command in `Terminal`using both`|`and`grep`:

```shell
cat names2.txt | grep "Sue"
```

This returns the following:

```shell
3 Sue
```

Basically, the `grep` command `filters` through cat `names2.txt` to `match` the
text search pattern `"Sue"`. Sweet, huh? I'm going to take this a step further
and actually use `|` and `grep` to search through a large file. In fact, I would
use `/etc` again. So:

```shell
ls -la /etc | grep -c "root"
```

would return the following:

```shell
252
```

This means that "root" appears in 252 lines in `/etc`. `/etc` sure does have a
large number of lines in its `stdout` to `Terminal`!

Let's make `|` and `grep` a bit more interesting. Let's say I want to `redirect`
the `output` of `ls -la` to `/home/maria/Desktop/list-home-directory.txt`. I
`add` an `absolute path` to a new file I want to create called
`list-home-directory.txt` because I am running it from `/home/maria/Desktop`.
First I type the following command in `Terminal`:

```shell
maria@maria-VirtualBox: ls -la /home/maria > /home/maria/Desktop/list-home-directory.txt
```

Then I `cd` into `Desktop` again, and run `cat list-home-directory.txt` to make
sure that my command worked. And it worked! The complete contents of
`/home/maria` was redirected to the newly created `file` on the `Desktop` called
`list-home-directory.txt`!

Next, I run the following command using `|` AND `grep`:

```shell
cat list-home-directory.txt | grep drwx
```

This `returns` the `directories` where I have `read`, `write`, and `execute`
permissions. The following is returned:

```shell
drwxr-x--- 16 maria maria 4096 Jul 13 11:14 .
drwxr-xr-x  3 root  root  4096 Jul 12 20:47 ..
drwx------ 10 maria maria 4096 Jul 12 20:56 .cache
drwxr-xr-x 15 maria maria 4096 Jul 12 20:56 .config
drwxr-xr-x  2 maria maria 4096 Jul 13 12:23 Desktop
drwxr-xr-x  2 maria maria 4096 Jul 12 20:54 Documents
drwxr-xr-x  2 maria maria 4096 Jul 12 20:56 .icons
drwxrwxrwx  3 maria maria 4096 Jul 12 21:06 .linuxmint
drwxrwxr-x  4 maria maria 4096 Jul 12 20:56 .local
drwxr-xr-x  2 maria maria 4096 Jul 12 20:54 Music
drwxr-xr-x  2 maria maria 4096 Jul 12 20:54 Pictures
drwxr-xr-x  2 maria maria 4096 Jul 12 20:54 Public
drwxr-xr-x  2 maria maria 4096 Jul 12 20:54 Templates
drwxrwxr-x  2 maria maria 4096 Jul 12 20:56 .themes
drwxr-xr-x  2 maria maria 4096 Jul 12 20:54 Videos
```

I `filtered through` the `contents` of `list-home-directory.txt` to find
`file permissions` for `directories` where use`r permissions` are `rwx`, and the
search text pattern is `dwrx`, `d` standing for `directory`. A lot less lines
than are contained in `list-home-directory.txt`. This was a quick way of going
through a `long list` of `lines` to find out which directories in `/home/maria`
for which I have `rwx` permissions.

## So what is a `named pipe` anyway?

An `un-named pipe` (`|`) in `Terminal` is `not persistent` by default. The `|`
command `cannot` be `accessed` by another `Terminal` window session. Only within
the current window. The `|` is `created temporarily` to `accommodate` the
`execution` of the `command` to the left of it and `redirect stdout`. `|` is
deleted after successful execution of the command.

On the other hand, a `named pipe` can last as long as the system is up and
running or until the `named pipe` is `deleted`. It is a `special file` that
follows the `FIFO` (`first in`, `first out`) method. In fact, it is a
`FIFO method`.

To create a `named pipe`, I run the following command in the directory I want to
save it to:

```shell
maria@maria-VirtualBox:~/Desktop/text-files$ mkfifo first-named-pipe
```

And when I run the `ls -la` command in the `text-files` directory to double
check my command:

```shell
ls -la
```

it returns the following:

```shell
total 24
drwxrwxr-x  2 maria maria   4096    Jul 13 16:21    .
drwxr-xr-x  4 maria maria   4096    Jul 13 16:10    ..
-rw-rw-r--  1 maria maria     47    Jul 12 21:28    duplicates.txt
prw-rw-r--  1 maria maria      0    Jul 13 16:21    first-named-pipe
-rw-rw-r--  1 maria maria   1477    Jul 13 12:23    list-home-directory.txt
-rw-rw-r--  1 maria maria     21    Jul 12 21:10    names1.txt
-rw-rw-r--  1 maria maria     18    Jul 12 21:18    names2.txt
```

Next, I run the following command to make sure that executing `first-named-pipe`
does not keep hanging in Terminal:

```shell
exec 3<>first-named-pipe
```

Next, I `redirect` the `command` I want to `capture` with `first-named-pipe` by
running the following:

```shell
maria@maria-VirtualBox:~/Desktop.text-files$ ls -la > first-named-pipe
```

This redirects `ls -la` for the contents of `text-files` as `stdout` to the
`first-named-pipe` **named pipe** file.

Finally, I execute the `named pipe` itself with the `cat` command:

```shell
maria@maria-VirtualBox:~/Desktop.text-files$ cat first-named-pipe
```

Which returns:

```shell
duplicates.txt
first-named-pipe
list-home-directory.txt
names1.txt
names2.txt
```

However, I did have problems getting my `named pipe` to work. The fact that I
had to set `exec 3<>` on `first-named-pipe` so that `execution` of the
`named pipe` would not `hang`, and that `after` the `first execution`, I was not
able to execute again, told me that named pipes just are not worth it. And they
cannot handle much data either. I would just stick with shell scripts!

I subsequently found the following on
[stackoverflow](https://askubuntu.com/questions/439289/cat-to-named-pipe-causes-hang):

I am using `Linux Mint`, which is `derived` from `Ubuntu`, and there is a `1 MB`
buffer limit, so I ran the following to see how big my buffer limit was when
executing my named pipe:

```shell
sysctl fs.pipe-max-size
```

returns:

```shell
fs.pipe-max-size = 1048576
```

which denotes `1048576` bytes. `1048576` bytes is `1MB`. That is not much in the
grand scheme of things, but I was having issues with very small amounts of data
as well. `Each time` I `wanted` to `execute` my `named pipe`, I had to do
something like the following:

```shell
exec 3<>first-named-pipe
ls -l > first-namede-pipe
cat first named-pipe
```

The `named pipe` is executed, but remains hanging after the `output` of the
`named pipe` has been `executed`. So I have to do `Control key` + `C key` to
`exit` the `pipe`.

What is interesting, however, is that after having done the above (several
times), I had no problem `redirecting stdout` to `first-named-pipe` and then
`cat > first-named-pipe`. I just had to make sure to `redirect` a `command` to
`first-named-pipe` before `re-executing` it. I could not simply run
`cat first-named-pipe` right after running `cat first-named-pipe`. It would
`result` in an `empty hang` containing `no stdout`. But if I were to try and
redirect a large amount of data, let's say from `/etc`, that would be way beyond
the `1 MB` limit, and `first-named-pipe` would never execute!

I am still `not` quite `sure` what are the `true benefits` of `named pipes`, but
as I learn more, I will share my findings!
