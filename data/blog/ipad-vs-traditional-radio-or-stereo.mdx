***So many*** great `radio apps` for `iPad` (and the ***sound*** is ***fantastic*** on the `iPad`). ***Unless*** you are ***into playing*** `CDs`, `hardware radio`, or `records` ***exclusively***, there is ***no need*** for the `"old fashioned"` ***clunky stereo***. ***Of course*** if you ***do happen*** to ***have*** one ***already***, ***don't*** get rid ***of it***!

***Some free*** `radio apps` which I ***have found*** in the `Apple App store` for `iPad` are the ***following***:

- `radio.net` (`radio and podcast`): the ***developer*** is `radio.de GmbH`. comes ***free***, but there is a ***premium tier*** if you ***don't want*** `ads` of any kind. I personally ***don't care***. I ***chose*** the ***free tier***. It ***contains*** an ***infinte number*** of `stations` in the ***mix***! ***Anything from*** `WNYC`, `WQXR`, to `BBC Radio`, `Voice of America`, `MSNBC News`, `franceinfo` (which I already have as its own separate app), etc. ***This one*** is a ***must***!

- `Amazon Music (Songs and Podcasts)`: the ***developer*** is `AMZN Mobile LLC`. Available ***free*** to those who ***subscribe*** to `Amazon Prime`. It is ***also available*** on `iPhone`. I ***have*** to ***install*** it ***there too***!

- `rne (Radio Nacional de Espana)`: The ***developer*** is `Corporacion RTVE`. It is ***free***, and has a ***wonderful collection*** of `substations` and `programs`. ***Live*** from ***Spain***!

*Happy internet radio listening!*
