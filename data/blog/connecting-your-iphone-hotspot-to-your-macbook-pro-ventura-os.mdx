The **_other day_**, **_during_** my **_last_** `class session` of the
`Web Design` **_course_** I was **_teaching_** this **_past semester_**,
**_all_** of a **_sudden_** I **_could not use_** my `iPhone’s` `hotspot` to
**_connect_** to the `internet`. This **_never_** had **_happened_** to **_me_**
before. **_But then_**, I **_was now_** on `macOS Ventura` and the school
`tech support` was **_not_** on site **_that day_**, **_whatever_** that
**_might have meant_** for **_privately owned_** `computers` on `campus` **_that
day_**.

In **_such_** a **_case_**, **_in order_** for your `iPhone’s hotspot` to be
**_connected_** to your `MacBook Pro`, you **_have_** to **_go into_**
`System Settings`, which can be **_found_** under the `Apple icon` in the
`MacBook Pro navigation menu` at the `top left` of the `screen`, and then
**_under_** `WiFi` in the `left sidebar`. It **_looks_** like **_this_**:

And **_then_** like **_this_**:

You **_need_** to **_manually connect_** your `iPhone’s hotspot` to your
`computer` **_from inside_** `System Settings`. I **_guess_** that
**_provides_** an **_extra layer_** of `security`.

If you **_suddenly_** can **_no longer_** `connect` your `iPhone’s hotspot` the
**_old way_**, **_simply_** by **_turning_** it **_on_** on the `iPhone`
**_itself_**, that is **_because_** `Ventura` is **_making_** you **_connect_**
`from within` your `MacBook Pro Apple M1Max`!

The **_reason_** I **_had_** to **_go in_** and **_connect manually_** from
inside my `MacBook Pro’s System Settings` was **_because_** of **_something_**
to **_do_** with the `School WiFi` in **_relation_** to my `Mac`. **_At home_**,
I **_have never_** had to **_connect_** my `iPhone hotspot` to my `MacBook Pro`
**_that way_**. I really **_don’t know_** what the **_story_** with **_that
was_**, because it did **_not happen_** `anywhere else`, but **_this_** is the
`solution` if you **_ever_** `come across` **_such_** a **_situation_** `over` a
`network` that is **_not_** `your own`.

**_Happy iPhone Hotspotting!_**
