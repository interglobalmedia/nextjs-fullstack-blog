**Update December 3, 2018:** There were some **_issues_** along the way
**_due to_** `breaking changes` in `Babel 7` which **_affected_** `Jest`,
`React`, and `ESLint`. **_Unless_** you are ***using***
`create-react-app`, your ***workflow*** might have to be **_adjusted_**
***depending*** on what ***support*** you want to **_provide_** in ***any given***
`application`. I have brought **_all resources_** `together` in the
**_repository_** for the `second edition` of my ***custom*** `React Workflow` on
`Github`. ***Please visit*** [issues](https://github.com/interglobalmedia/react-workflow-updated-2018/issues/1) to ***learn more***.

***Some*** of ***you*** may ***know*** that I ***created*** a `custom workflow` ***last year*** without using `create-react-app`, but **_emulating_** its `core features`. I then ***gave*** a ***presentation*** at the `React NYC Meetup`. The
***organizers*** thought it ***too long***, and I was ***not able*** to ***finish*** the ***presentation*** `live`, but that was ***OK***! I had **_created_** the `presentation` with [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/#/), and the **_complete_** `workflow documentation` was ***included*** there. To **_view_** the `first edition` of my ***custom*** `React workflow` (***now*** a ***bit outdated***), ***please visit*** the [React Workflow Presentation](https://interglobalmedia.github.io/react-workflow-presentation/#/).

I ***became focused*** on ***deeper dives*** into **Javascript** (***without*** `React`, ***don’t ask*** lol), `Nodejs`, and `back end`, so my `focus` **_turned away from_** `React` for ***a bit***.

***When*** I ***came back*** to **_update_** some `React apps` and ***other*** `JS` ***related*** things, I ***saw*** that **_much_** had **_changed_**. And ***that’s*** when I ***decided*** to ***update*** the ***first edition*** of my `workflow` so I could ***catch up*** to what was ***happening*** in the **JavaScript** **_hemisphere_**!

I ***just completed*** the `workflow` ***last night***. As I ***write*** in my ***project associated*** with the ***repository***,

> This is the second edition of a custom workflow I created for my React
> applications, incorporating changes that took place in React 16.6.3, ESLint
> 5.9.0, Babel 7, and Webpack 4. This is not meant as an all inclusive example
> of what has changed in those dependencies/devDependencies. Hopefully it will
> encourage others to take a deeper dive into them and expand their horizons as
> developers. I know that creating this deck expanded my horizons, and I had
> loads of fun learning new things along the way.

I ***also encourage*** those who ***decide*** to ***try out*** my `workflow` to ***let*** me ***know how*** it ***goes***! I ***want*** to ***be able*** to ***improve upon*** my `implementations` and `documentations` ***going forward***. And if you have ***any issues*** or ***questions***, please ***create them*** in
the ***issues section*** of the ***repository***! Thanks!
