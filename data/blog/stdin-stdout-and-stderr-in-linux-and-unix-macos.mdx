I just published a post entitled
[Redirect operators in Linux and Unix (macOS)](/blog/redirect-operators-in-linux-and-unix-macos),
in which I discussed how to redirect `stdin` (`standard input`) and `stdout`
(`standard output`), and why one would want to do it in the first place. This
post will take the concept of redirection to the next level.

In
[Redirect operators in Linux and Unix (macOS)](/blog/redirect-operators-in-linux-and-unix-macos),
I discussed default `stdin` and `stdout` and their associated
`redirector operators`: `<` representing the `stdin redirector operator`, and
`>` representing the `stdout redirector operator`. There is a third
`data stream` called `stderr`.

## 3 data streams in Linux: `stdin`, `stdout`, and `stderr`

There are 3 `data streams` in `Linux` that can be used to transport data related
to a command. As discussed in my article entitled
[Redirect operators in Linux and Unix (macOS)](/blog/redirect-operators-in-linux-and-unix-macos),
`stdin` is the `input stream`, `stdout` is the `output stream`, and `stderr` is
the `error stream`. If you are a developer, IT network administrator, network
support specialist, or cybersecurity professional, for example, you are very
familiar with errors. Cybersecurity professionals are constantly dealing with
logging errors related to network security.

`stdin`, `stdout`, and `stderr` are three standard `data streams` that one
`creates` when `executing` a `command` in `Linux`. And what is a `stream`?
According to
[opensource.com](https://opensource.com/article/18/10/linux-data-streams),

> As its name implies, a data stream is a stream of data—especially text
> data—being passed from one file, device, or program to another using STDIO
> (stdin/stdout). &mdash; **_David Both,
> [opensource.com](https://opensource.com/article/18/10/linux-data-streams)_**

And then David Both goes on to say,

> In the `Unix` and `Linux` worlds, a `stream` is a `flow` of `text data` that
> originates at some source; the `stream` may flow to one or more programs that
> `transform` it in some way, and then it may be stored in a file or displayed
> in a `terminal` session. As a `sysadmin`, your job is intimately associated
> with `manipulating` the `creation` and `flow` of these `data streams`. In this
> post, we will explore `data streams`—what they are, how to create them, and a
> little bit about how to use them.

`stdin` is `represented` by `File handle 0`, `stdout` is `represented` by
`File handle 1`, and `stderr` is `represented` by `File handle 2`.

## Streams are treated like files in Linux

So why `File handle 0`, `file handle 1`, and `File handle 2`, when dealing with
`stdin`, `stdout`, and `stderr`? Because in `Linux`, `streams` are treated like
`files`. We can `read` a `file` or `write data` into a `file`.

## `stderr` data stream

When a `stdout` is `redirected` to a `file` instead of `Terminal`, and the
s`tdout` is `not displayed` in the `Terminal` window because of an `error` in
the `data output` represented by `stderr` to the `Terminal window`
(`by default`) instead, there is a `redirector` which can `redirect` the
`stderr data` from `Terminal` to `another source`. This can also `ensure` that
the `data persists` and saved somewhere (else). This proves very useful in
`cybersecurity` for **_saving_** `network logging errors` to a `file`, for
example.

Let's say I run a command in `Terminal` that `lists` the `contents` of a
`directory` that `does not exist`:

```shell
ls linux-scripting
```

The following is returned in `Terminal`:

```shell
ls: cannot access 'linux-scripting': No such file or directory
```

Let's say I run `ls linux-scripting` but `redirect` this `command`:

```shell
ls linux-scripting > list-directory.txt
```

The following is `added` to the `list-directory.txt file`:

```shell
ls: cannot access 'linux-scripting': No such file or directory
```

The same message is output to `Terminal`, because `stderr` itself has `not` been
`redirected`. Now let's say I run the following command in `Terminal`:

```shell
ls linux-scripting 2> list-directory.txt
```

The following is returned in `Terminal`:

```shell

```

That's right. Nothing! That's because I am using a `stderr redirector operator`.
The `2` points to `stderr` (represented by `File handle 2`), and `>` is the
`stdout redirector operator`, and `redirects` the `stderr output` to the
`list-directory.txt` file. When I open `list-directory.txt` with the `vim`
command:

```shell
vim list-directory.txt
```

or run the `cat` command on `list-directory.txt`:

```shell
cat list-directory.txt
```

the following appears in `vim` or is returned in `Terminal`:

```shell
ls: cannot access 'linux-scripting': No such file or directory
```

I can also `redirect` both `stdout` and `stderr` to my `list-directory.txt` file
with the following command:

```shell
ls macos-scripting linux-scripting > list-directory.txt 2>&1
```

results in the following in `Terminal`:

```shell
ls: cannot access 'linux-scripting': No such file or directory
macos-scripting:
```

Now two lines exist. `macos-scripting:` just means that it is an empty directory
(which it actually is). And what does `2>&1` mean? It means that I want to
`redirect` the `output` of the results of both my `stdout` represented by
`File handle 1` AND `stderr` represented by `File handle 2` to my
`list-directory.txt` file. And the regular `stdout redirector operator`
**_redirects_** the `output` of `ls macos-scripting linux-scripting` to
`list-directory.txt`. But since there is no `linux-scripting` directory, the
`stderr` resulting from that `redirects` to `list-directory.txt` as well, but
**_does not_** `output` to `Terminal` because of the `2>&1` `stderr stdout`
**_redirect_**.

There is also a `shortcut` for `2>&1`. It is the following:

```shell
ls macos-scripting linux-scripting &> list-directory.txt
```

The `result` is the same as for `2>&1` appended to the end of the command. So
the following appears when I run `vim list-directory.txt`:

```shell
ls: cannot access 'linux-scripting': No such file or directory
macos-scripting:
```

And when I run `cat list-directory.txt`, the following is returned in `Terminal`
as well:

```shell
ls: cannot access 'linux-scripting': No such file or directory
macos-scripting:
```

`&>` is the `shortcut` for `2>&1`.

But let's say that I want to `get rid of` the `stderr message` altogether? I
would run the following:

```shell
ls linux-scripting macos-scripting 2> /dev/null > list-directory.txt
```

and then I run `cat list-directory.txt` and the following is returned in
Terminal:

```shell
macos-scripting:
script1.txt
script2.txt
```

This time the `macos-scripting` directory is not empty. It contains two files
called `script1.txt` and `script2.txt`. There is no error message because it was
redirected to a special file called `/dev/null` on the `Linux OS`.

According to `Aidela Karamyan` on
[baeldung.com](https://www.baeldung.com/linux/fix-missing-dev-null),

> In the shell scripting world /dev/null is a fundamental concept. Its
> accidental deletion might wreak havoc on the system because many system
> processes rely on it. So, knowing what /dev/null is and how to work with it is
> essential for any Linux developer. &mdash; Aidela Karamyan,
> [baeldung.com](https://www.baeldung.com/linux/fix-missing-dev-null)

She goes on to say,

> In Linux systems, devices are files stored in the /dev directory. These files
> can represent both physical and virtual devices. /dev/null is a virtual null
> device used to discard any output redirected to it. &mdash; Aidela Karamyan,
> [baeldung.com](https://www.baeldung.com/linux/fix-missing-dev-null)

One can also **_suppress_** `stdout` as well. Perhaps in certain cases all we
want to save IS the `stderr message` and not the `stdout data`. Let's try that
out!

```shell
ls macos-scripting linux-scripting &> /dev/null
```

returns nothing. `ls macos-scripting` is also suppressed. But when I run the
following in `Terminal`:

```shell
ls macos-scripting
```

the following is returned in `Terminal`:

```shell
script1.txt script2.txt
```

So `ls macos-scripting linux-scripting &> /dev/null` suppresses both `stdout`
and `stderr`, `redirecting` their `outputs` to the special `/dev/null` file
which then `discards` that `redirected output` forever.

If I run the following in `Terminal`:

```shell
ls macos-scripting > /dev/null
```

it is the same as running the command `ls macos-scripting 1> /dev/null`. By
`omitting` the `File handle`, `1` or `2`, it implicitly refers to `stdout`,
because `>` is the `stdout redirector operator` and `stdout` has a `File handle`
of `1`.

Now let's say I ran the following in `Terminal`:

```shell
echo Hi there! > /dev/null
```

And then ran:

```shell
cat /dev/null
```

The following would be returned in `Terminal`:

```shell

```

That's right. Nothing. `/dev/null` discards `Hi there!`. But let's say I did the
following:

```shell
ls macos-scripting linux-scripting &> /dev/null > list-directory.txt
```

And then I ran the following:

```shell
cat list-directory.txt
```

The following is returned in `Terminal`:

```shell
macos-scripting:
script1.txt
script2.txt
```

You may wonder why there is actually content inside the `list-directory.txt`. I
did make sure to delete the contents of `list-directory.txt` before running the
command. Even though `&>` is supposed to `redirect` both `stderr` and `stdout`
to `/dev/null` and then be discarded there, it is only the `stderr` resulting
from `ls linux-scripting` that is redirected to `/dev/null`. The output of
`ls macos-scripting` is `redirected` to `list-directory.txt`. `&>` is short for
`2>&1`, which means that first stderr is redirected to `/dev/null`, and then
`&1`, which refers to `stdout`, is redirected to `> list-directory.txt`.

Again, if I run the following:

```shell
ls macos-scripting linux-scripting &> /dev/null
```

Nothing would be returned in `Terminal`. The results of
`ls macos-scripting linux-scripting` would all be `redirected` to `/dev/null`
and `discarded`.
