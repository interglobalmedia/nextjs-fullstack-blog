I have previously written posts about
[creating an AppleScript that plays an album in the macOS Music app](/blog/creating-an-applescript-that-plays-an-album-in-the-macos-music-app)
and
[creating a shell script from an AppleScript targeting the macOS Music app](/blog/creating-a-shell-script-from-an-applescript-targeting-the-macos-music-app).
Now I will discuss creating an AppleScript that plays a single song in the macOS
Music app.

First, I made sure to create my schell script file inside a folder I had created
for all my shell scripts called `macos-scripting` located at the root of my home
folder (`~`). The folder hierarachy looks like the following:

```markdown
~/ #home folder

-   macos-scripting/ concatenate.sh concatenate.txt download_install_firefox.sh
    play_album.sh play_song.sh wifi_reset.sh
```

It is important to keep all shell scripts in one place. It is also important to
give a recognizable and memorable name to the folder so that it is easy to find.

Next, I added the following at the top of the file:

```shell
#!/bin/zsh
```

This shebang (`#!`), is followed by the path to `zsh` in `/bin`, and is what
distinguishes this file as a (`zsh`) shell script. Specifically, `#!/bin/zsh`
tells the computer that we want to use zsh as the default shell. `/bin/zsh` is
the path to zsh eecutables. `/bin` stands for `binary` â€” a directory of all
executable commands for our apps.

Next, I add the shell script (technically AppleScript using the osascript
command):

```shell
#!/bin/zsh

osascript -e 'tell application "Music"
  set mySongs to every track of library playlist 1 whose artist is "Spirit Nation" and name is "Wankatakiya"
  repeat with aSong in mySongs
      play aSong
  end repeat
end tell'
```

Here, the script is telling the Music app to play a song called "Wankatakiya" by
the artist "Spirit Nation". The app plays that one song, and then stops. That's
because tje script is speicifcally targeting the artist `Spirit Nation` AND
their single song `Wankatakiya`. However, if I were to change the code the
script to the following:

```shell
#!/bin/zsh

osascript -e 'tell application "Music"
  set mySongs to every track of library playlist 1 whose artist is "Spirit Nation"
  repeat with aSong in mySongs
      play aSong
  end repeat
end tell'
```

The Music app would play the single song called "Spirit Nation" by
`Spirit Nation`. That is because this time `whose artist is "Spirit Nation"` is
not followed by the `and` operator and then a specific song.

If I were to do the following:

```shell
#!/bin/zsh

osascript -e 'tell application "Music"
  set mySongs to every track of library playlist 1 whose artist is "Creed"
  repeat with aSong in mySongs
      play aSong
  end repeat
end tell'
```

This plays the last song of the last Creed album alphabetically listed under
`"Artists" -> "Creed"`. First there is the album "Himan Clay", then "My Own
Prison", and finally "Weathered". And the last song in "Weathered" is the song
"Lullaby", and that is what the script plays.

And just as with any code, especially Python, for example, the script has to be
correctly formatted/indented. Otherwise it does not work!
