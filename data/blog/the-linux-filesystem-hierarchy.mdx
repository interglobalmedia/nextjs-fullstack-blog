## The Linux filesystem

At a `high level`, the `Linux filesystem` follows the
`Filesystem Hierarchy Standard` (`FHS`). This standard `describes` the common
`layout conventions` used `by` most `UNIX` and `UNIX-like` systems. It
`consists` of a `single primary` or `root directory` with multiple
`branching sub-directories`.

`/` represents the `root` of the `Linux filesystem`. It is `under` this `root`
directory that `all` other `files` and `directories reside`. The
`Filesystem Hierarchy Standard` (`FHS`) `describes` the `different directories`
and `what files` are `located` in `which directories`.

If we have `Ubuntu` or a `Ubuntu derivative` installed (like `Linux Mint` for
example), we can `install` a `package` called `tree` by `running` the
`following command` in `Terminal`:

```shell
# to update current packages. updates the list of available packages and their versions, but it does not install or upgrade any packages.
sudo apt update
# actually installs newer versions of the packages you have. After updating the lists, the package manager knows about available updates for the software you have installed. This is why you first want to update.
sudo apt upgrade
# now you are ready to install tree
sudo apt install tree
```

Now we can `run` a `command` like the `following`:

```shell
tree /
```

The `tree` command `lists contents` of `directories` in a `tree-like` format in
`Linux`. `With` no `args`, it `lists` the `files` and `sub-directories` in the
`current directory`. `With` directory `args` (such as `/` or `~`), `tree` lists
`all` the `files` and/or `directories` found in the `given directories`.
`When completing` the `list` of all `files` and `directories` found, `tree`
returns the `total number` of `files` and/or `directories` listed. It is far too
long to share here, but `you should` definitely `run` this `command` to see what
is the `resulting output`.

If we want a `short list` of `files` and `directories` in `root` (`/`), for
example, we can `run` something like the `following` instead:

```shell
# run from root directory `/`
tree -L 1 /
```

`This results` in the following `stdout` to `Terminal`:

```shell
/
|___ bin -> usr/bin
|___ boot
|___ cdrom
|___ dev
|___ etc
|___ home
|___ lib -> usr/lib
|___ lib64 -> usr/lib64
|___ lost+found
|___ media
|___ mnt
|___ opt
|___ proc
|___ root
|___ run
|___ sbin -> usr/sbin
|___ srv
|___ swapfile
|___ sys
|___ tmp
|___ usr
|___ var

21 directories. 1 file
```

`What` this `command` essentially `is doing` is it `shows only` the
`first level` of the `directory tree` starting at `root` (/). The `-L option`
tells `tree` how many `levels down` we `want` to `see`. `Here`, we `indicate` 1
`level`.

Let's say I `run` the `following command` instead, also from `/` root:

```shell
tree -L 2 /
```

`This results` in the `following stdout` to `Terminal`:

```shell
...
479 directories, 369 files
```

The `stdout` is `too long` to `share` here, but as shown above, it `results` in
`479 directories` and `369 files`! And so on.

## Types of files in Linux

In `Linux` and `Unix systems`, `everything` is `considered` a `file`. `If` it
`isn't`, it's a `running process`. Basically, `files` fall under `three`
different `categories` in `Linux`:

-   `Regular files`: these include text files, photos, videos, programs, and
    executable files.
-   `Directories`: in Linux, directories are also considered files since they
    provide storage for other files and sub-directories.
-   `Special files`: device files that are made up of symbolic links, block
    files, socket files, and named pipe files.

## /bin

The `/bin` directory, which stands for `'binary'` directory, is the `root`
`/bin` directory where `executable files` are `stored`. These `/bin` directories
are `storage locations` for important `commands` and `programs`. If I `run` the
`ls /bin` command, the `following` is `returned`:

```shell
'['
7z
7za
7zr
aa-enabled
aa-exec
aa-features-abi
aconnect
acpi_listen
add-apt-repository
addpart
addr2line
add-remove-locales
airscan-discover
alpine
alpinef
alsabat
alsaloop
alsamixer
...
join
...
tar
...
touch
...
whoami
...
zless
zmore
znew
zstd
zstdcat
zstdgrep
zstdless
zstdmt
```

And if I run `ls /bin | wc -l`, the `following` is `returned`:

```shell
1941
```

`That` is `a lot` of `commands` and `programs`! One can find out the path to a
command by running the `which` command followed by the `command` itself.
`Something` like the `following`:

```shell
which crontab
# which returns:
/usr/bin/crontab
```

The `which` command `locates` a `command` in `/bin`. Here it `locates` the
`path` to the `crontab` command. I can also `locate` the `grep` command, for
example:

```shell
which grep
# which returns:
/usr/bin/grep
```

`On` the `other hand`, a `command` like `cd` is a built-in `shell` command, so
running `which cd` returns `nothing`. To `learn more` about built-in `shell`
commands in `Ubuntu bash`, please visit
[Ubuntu bash builtins](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/focal/en/man7/bash-builtins.7.html).
There is also a `great explanation` of why `cd`, for example, `cannot` be an
`executable` on `"ask Ubuntu"` in the `thread` entitled
[Why wouldn't the `which` command work for `cd`? I can't find the executable for `cd` either!](https://askubuntu.com/questions/532788/why-wouldnt-the-which-command-work-for-cd-i-cant-find-the-executable-for).

## /boot

The `/boot` directory `contains` all the `files` needed for `starting` the
`system` (aka `boot process`). The `/boot` directory is `mounted directly` on
the `root directory` (`/`) and is called `/boot`.

When I run `ls /boot` in my `Linux Mint OS` Virtual Machine, I `get back` the
`following`:

```shell
config-5.15.0-117-generic      initrd.img.old
config-5.15.0-91-generic       System.map-5.15.0-117-generic
efi                            System.map-5.15.0-91-generic
grub                           vmlinuz
initrd.img                     vmlinuz-5.15.0-117-generic
initrd.img-5.15.0-117-generic  vmlinuz-5.15.0-91-generic
initrd.img-5.15.0-91-generic   vmlinuz.old
```

`Files` included in `/boot` are `grub` boot loader `files` **[^1]**, `root`
filesystem `files`, `Linux` kernel `files` (`vmlinuz`), and other `boot`
configuration files.

`grub`, or [GRand Unified Bootloader](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/GRUB), is
the `boot loader`. The `current grub` is also known as `GRUB 2`.

`GRUB` includes its `own support` for `multiple file systems`, especially
`FAT32`, `ext4`, `Btrfs` or `XFS`.

`initrd`, or `initial ramdisk`, is `used` for `loading` a temporary
`root filesystem` into `memory`, to be `used` as `part` of the `Linux` startup
process. `initramfs` is `used` as `another way` of `loading` a temporary
`root filesystem` into `memory` and is `used` as `part` of the `Linux` startup
process as well. `Both methods` are `commonly used` to `make preparations`
before the real `root file system` can be `mounted`.

### /boot partition

[According to archlinux](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Partitioning#/boot) (a
lightweight `Linux distribution`),

> The
> [boot loader](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Arch_boot_process#Boot_loader)
> must be able to access the /boot partition. In other words, the boot loader
> must have support for everything starting from the block devices, stacked
> block devices (LVM, RAID, dm-crypt, LUKS, etc) and ending with the file system
> on which the kernel(s) and initramfs image(s) reside...File systems can get
> new features not yet supported by
> [boot loaders](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Arch_boot_process#Boot_loader)
> (e.g.
> [archlinux/packaging/packages/grub#7](https://gitlab.archlinux.org/archlinux/packaging/packages/grub/-/issues/7),
> [FS#79857](https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/79857),
> [FS#59047](https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/59047),
> [FS#58137](https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/58137),
> [FS#51879](https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/51879),
> [FS#46856](https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/46856),
> [FS#38750](https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/38750),
> [FS#21733](https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/21733) and
> [fscrypt](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Fscrypt) encrypted directories),
> making them unsuitable for a /boot partition unless disabling incompatible
> features. This can be typically avoided by using
> [FAT32](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/FAT) since it is supported by
> practically everything and it will not be getting any new features.

In addition, `FAT32` works `with` all `versions` of `Mac`, `Windows`, `Linux`
machines, and `gaming devices`.

That being said and shown, it is `important` to `note` that we should` not`
touch anything in `/boot`, `otherwise` it `might break` our `system` and we
would `not` be `able` to `run` our `Linux OS`. However, `as long as` we are
`not running` as `root`, we would `not` be `able` to access `/boot` anyway.

## /cdrom

When I ran `ls -l /cdrom`, the `following` was `returned`:

```shell
total 0
```

Apparently, it is an `empty directory` in `Linux Mint`. I could `not` find
`anything` specifically `about` this `directory` in `Linux Mint`, but I
`did find` the `following` about `/cdrom` in `Linux` on
[askUbuntu](https://askubuntu.com/questions/13706/why-does-cdrom-folder-exist-shouldnt-it-be-media-cdrom-or-mnt-cdrom):

> While /mnt/ and /media/ are common places to mount devices, the device
> location can be just about anywhere. /cdrom/ was probably chosen for either
> brevity or legacy support.

But of course `this` was from `2010`, so who knows what its `function` is
`today` on `Linux Mint`, `especially` since `it is` an `empty directory`. I
subsequently `found` another `thread` entitled
[cdrom folder empty](https://forums.linuxmint.com/viewtopic.php?t=202858) on the
`Linux Mint` forum, and a `user` there `stated` the `following` in `response` to
`another` user's `question` as to `why` the `/cdrom` directory was `empty`:

> What makes you think that the folders should go anywhere other than where they
> already are?... and what makes you think that you should open them?
>
> My system has been working perfectly for years... my cdrom folder is empty and
> my dev folder has almost 200 files - all of which contain 0 bytes! What I am
> trying to say here is that I don't think there is anything wrong with your
> cdrom folder or your dev folder...
>
> I would suggest starting another thread or retitling this thread to something
> like "I can't use my DVD drive". Then edit your first post to include more
> information... the whole error message including what happens if you press S
> or M; what Mint version and DE your are using; does the DVD icon appear in you
> Computer view?; etc...

`Don't worry` about `this one`, `especially` if you are a `Linux Mint` user
`like myself`. It's an `empty directory`, and `it seems` to `be meant` to
`be empty`. Just move on!

## /dev

`/dev` contains `device files`. `When` we `connect` a `device` to our `machine`,
the `device` usually `needs` a `device driver` to `function` properly. We can
`interact` with `device drivers` through `device files` or `device nodes`
**[^1]**. These are `special files` that `look` like `regular files`. Since
these `device files` are just `like` regular `files`, we can `use` programs such
as `ls`, `cat`, `etc`., to `interact` with `them`.

The `system` creates `/dev` files `during installation`, and they `must` be
`available` during the `boot process`. `Device` files are `abstractions` of
`standard devices` that applications `interact with` via `I/O system calls`
**[^2]**.

`Most` of the `files listed` (ls -l /dev) are either `block` or `character`
devices. We can tell `which` is `which` by the `first character` in the `file`'s
`permissions`. For example, `if` the `first character` in the file's permissions
`is` a `c`, that `means` it is a `character` file.

### block devices

```shell
# example of a black file in /dev
brw-rw----  1 root disk     7,  0 Jul 28 09:33 loop0
```

The `above` is a `block device` file as `indicated by` the `b` in `column 1`,
the `file permissions`.

`Column 2` is the `number` of `links`.

`Column 3` is the `owner` (`root`).

`Column 4` is the `group` (`disk`).

`Column 5` is the `major device number` (`7`).

`Column 6` is the `minor device number` (`0`).

`Column 7` is the `timestamp` (`Jul 28 09:33`).

`Column 8` is the `device name` (`loop0`).

[`/dev/loop*`](https://askubuntu.com/questions/906581/what-is-dev-loopx) are
`loop devices` making `plain files` accessible as `block` devices. They are
typically `used` for mounting `disk images`. `Drivers` access `data` from
`block` devices via a `cache`, and `drivers` communicate with `block` devices by
sending `blocks` of `data`. Examples of `block` devices are `hard drives`,
`filesystems`, or `USBs` (`Universal Serial Bus`).

### character devices

`Character device` files in `Linux` are `special files` that allow
`direct communication` between `user programs` and `hardware devices`. They are
part of the `Linux filesystem` and play a `crucial role` in `Linux` system
administration.

`Character device` files, also known as `character special files`,
`provide access` to `devices` that `transfer` data `character` by `character`.
`These devices` typically include `terminals`, `serial ports`, and
`input/output` (`I/O`) `devices` such as `keyboards` and `mice`. `Unlike`
regular `files`, `character device` files do `not` store `data` but `instead`
act as a `conduit` for `data transfer` between `user programs` and the
`underlying hardware`.

### Device major and minor numbers

`Devices` are `characterized` using `two numbers`. `Major device number` and
`minor device number`. The `major device number` represents the `device driver`
that is `used`, and the `minor device number` tells the `kernel` which
`unique device` it is in the `driver class`. A `0` as `shown` in the
`example below`, `indicates` that it's the `first device`.

```shell
brw-rw----  1 root    disk      8,   0 Jul 28 09:33 sda # first hard disk
```

`Each driver` is assigned a `unique major number`, and all `device files` with
the `same major number` are `controlled` by the `same driver`.

The `minor number` is `used` by the `driver` to `distinguish between` the
`different hardwares` it `controls`. For example, `although` three `devices` may
be `handled by` the `same driver`, they have `unique minor numbers` because the
`driver` sees `them` as being `different pieces` of `hardware`.

### Device names

The most common `device names` that `appear` in `/dev` are `SCSI` devices,
`Pseudo` devices, and `PATA` devices.

`SCSI` devices `use` the `SCSI protocol`. `SCSI` stands for
`Small Computer System Interface`, and it is `used` to allow `communications`
between `disks`, `printers`, `scanners`, and `other peripherals` on the
`system`. `SCSI devices` are `not used` on `modern systems`,` but` in `Linux`,
`SCSI disks` correspond with `hard disk drives` in `/dev`. They are
`identified by` the `sd` prefix (`SCSI disk`). In my `Linux Mint OS`, I `have`
the following `sds`:

```shell
brw-rw----  1 root    disk      8,   0 Jul 28 09:33 sda # first hard disk
brw-rw----  1 root    disk      8,   1 Jul 28 09:33 sda1 # first partition on the first hard disk
brw-rw----  1 root    disk      8,   2 Jul 28 09:33 sda2 # second partition on the first hard disk
brw-rw----  1 root    disk      8,   3 Jul 28 09:33 sda3 # third partition on the first hard disk
```

And if I had `/dev/sdb`, it `would represent` the `second hard disk`.

`Pseudo` devices are `not` really `connected` to the `system`. And most
`pseudo devices` are `character devices` such `as` the `following`:

```shell
# accepts and discards all input, produces no output
crw-rw-rw-  1 root root   1, 3 Jul 28 09:33 null
# produces random numbers
crw-rw-rw-  1 root root   1, 8 Jul 28 09:33 random
# accepts and discards all input, produces a continuous stream of NULL (zero value) bytes
crw-rw-rw-  1 root root   1, 4 Jul 28  09:33  zero
```

With `PATA` devices, `which appear` in `older systems`, we may see `hard drives`
that are `represented by` the `hd` prefix:

```shell
/dev/hda # First hard disk
/dev/hdd2 # Second partition on 4th hard disk
```

### Symbolic links

`Symbolic links` in `/dev` are `there` for a `number` of `reasons`.

`Examples` of `symbolic links` are `/dev/stdin`, `/dev/stdout`, and
`/dev/stderr`:

```shell
lrwxrwxrwx  1 root    root          15 Jul 28 09:33 stderr -> /proc/self/fd/2
lrwxrwxrwx  1 root    root          15 Jul 28 09:33 stdin -> /proc/self/fd/0
lrwxrwxrwx  1 root    root          15 Jul 28 09:33 stdout -> /proc/self/fd/1
```

A `symbolic link`, aka symlink, to `another file` is `indicated by` an `l` at
the `beginning` of the `file permission`, as above. A `symbolic link` is a file
in `Linux` that `points` to `other files` or `directories` and `represents`
their `absolute` or `relative path`.

`/dev/stdin` points to /proc/self/fd/0, for example, because `/proc/self` sits
on the `/proc` filesystem. `When` a `process` reads `/proc/self`, it
`gets information` about itself `using` its `process id`. The `/proc/self`
directory is a `symbolic link` as well:

```shell
lrwx------ 1 maria maria 64 Jul 29 06:53 /proc/self/fd/0 -> /dev/pts/0
```

When I run `ls -l /dev/cdrom`, the `following` is `returned` in `Terminal`:

```shell
lrwxrwxrwx  root root 3 Jul 28 09:33 /dev/cdrom -> sr0
```

And what does `/dev/cdrom -> sr0` mean? `sr0` is a `device` on the
`scsi controller` **[^3]** (hypervisor). For those of us that use `Linux` in A
`VM` (`virtual machine`) like `VirtualBox`, for instance, it is the `"cdrom"`
that we `use` to `upload` our `Linux` `".iso"` image **[^4]** file into
`VirtualBox` to `install` our `Linux distribution` in the `VM`.

There are 203 `files` and `folders` in my `Linux Mint` `/dev` directory. Among
them (and in `Linux` in `general`)are `/dev/null`, which is a `virtual device`
that `discards` any `output` of a `script` or `command` that we `redirect` to
`it`. I `discuss it` and `provide examples` in my `article` entitled
[stdin stdout and stderr in Linux and Unix (macOS)](/blog/stdin-stdout-and-stderr-in-linux-and-unix-macos).

`There` is `more` to `/dev` than covered here. To `learn more`, you can visit
[devices](https://linuxjourney.com/lesson/dev-directory) on `linuxjourney.com`.

## /etc

`/etc` originally `stood` for `"et cetera"` because it was `where anything` that
was `difficult` to `find` a `place for` was `placed`. Now `"etc"` refers to
`everything` that `needs` to be `configured`. It `contains most` if `not all`
system-wide `configuration` files. Some `examples` of `configuration` files in
`/etc`:

```shell
# The user database, with fields giving the username, real name, home directory, and other information about each user. The format is documented in the passwd manual page.
-rw-r--r--  1 root root 3035  Jul 26 00:08  /etc/passwd
# /etc/shadow is an encrypted file the holds user passwords.
4 -rw--r------ 1 root shadow 1584Jul 26 00:08 /etc/shadow
# Files executed at login or startup time by the Bourne, BASH , or C shells. These allow the system administrator to set global defaults for all users. Users can also create individual copies of these in their home directory to personalize their environment. See the manual pages for the respective shells.
-rw-r--r--   1 root root  582 Oct 15 2021 /etc/profile
-rw-r--r--   1 root root 2319 Jan  6 2022 /etc/hash.bashrc
# Lists trusted shells. The chsh command allows users to change their login shell only to shells listed in this file. ftpd, is the server process that provides FTP services for a machine, will check that the user's shell is listed in /etc/shells and will not let people log in unless the shell is listed there.
-rw-r--r--   1 root root  128 Jan  9 2024 /etc/shells
```

## /home

`/home` is where `users'` personal `directories` reside. In my case, there is
`one directory` under `/home`: `/home/maria`. I have `created` another `user` on
the `system` called `magdala`, and her `/home` directory contains
`/home/magdala`.

## /lib

`/lib` is a `symbolic link` for `usr/lib`:

```shell
lrwxrwxrwx  1 root root 7 Jul 12 20:38 /lib -> usr/lib
```

There are 137 `files` and `folders` in `/usr/lib`:

```shell
ls -l /usr/lib | wc -l
# which returns:
137
```

[/usr/ib](https://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/FHS_3.0/fhs/ch04s06.html)
includes `libraries` for `programming` and `packages`. On some systems, it `may`
also `include` internal `binaries` that are `not intended` to be
`executed directly` by `users` or `shell scripts`.

`Applications` may `use` a single `sub-directory` under `/usr/lib`. `If` an
`application` uses a `sub-directory`, `all` architecture-dependent `data`
exclusively `used` by the `application` must `be placed` within that
`sub-directory`. Some examples are:

```shell
drwxr-xr-x  5 root root 4096 Jul 25 13:14 libreoffice
drwxr-xr-x  3 root root 4096 Jan  9 2024  linux
drwxr-xr-x 13 root root 4096 Jan  9 2024  linuxmint
```

## /lib64

`/lib64` is a `symbolic link` to `/usr/lib64`:

```shell
lrwxrwxrwx  1 root root 9 Jul 12 20:38 /lib64 -> usr/lib64
```

`/usr/lib64` is for `64-bit` libraries.

According to

## /lost+found

My `/lost+found` directory is `empty`, and oftentimes `they are`. However, they
are `system created directories` and should `not` be `touched`. They `may` be
`used` by the `system`, `specifically` the `fsck` command.

According to `man fsck`,

> The fsck command checks and repairs a Linux filesystem. fsck is used to check
> and optionally repair one or more Linux filesystems. Filesystem can be a
> device name such as /dev/hdc1 or /dev/sdb2, a mount point (i.e. /usr or
> /home), or a filesystem label or UUID specifier (i.e.,
> UUID=8868abf6-88c5-4a83-98b8-bfc24057f7bd, or LABL=root). Normally, the fsck
> program will try to handle filesystems on different physical disk drives in
> parallel to reduce the total amount of time needed to check all of them.

## /media

On my `Linux Mint OS` in `VirtualBox`, the `/media` directory `contains` the
`following`:

```shell
ls -lh /media
# which returns:
total 4.0K
drwxr-x---+ 3 root root 4.0K Jul 28 09:33 maria
# to find out what is in the maria directory:
ls -lh /media/maria
# which returns:
total 3.0K
dr-xr-xr-x 5 maria maria 2.6K May 22 05:22 VBox_GAs_7.0.18
```

`The above` is my `Guest Additions`, which is `needed` in `order` to `select`
bidirectional `Drag and Drop` and `Shared Clipboard`. By default, `they` are
both `disabled`. `In order` to `change them` to `"Bidirectional"`, we have to go
to the `General` tab in our `Linux Mint Settings` and then `select` the
`"Advanced"` tab. If we `want` to `be able` to `copy` from `Linux Mint` in
`VirtualBox` onto our `native OS` (like `Windows 11` for example), we need to
properly mount and install `VBox_GAs_7.0.18` `".iso"` in `VirtualBox`.

## /mnt

`/mnt` is a `legacy` directory. `It` is `where` we `used` to `manually` mount
`storage devices` or `partitions`. It is `not used` much `these days`.

According to the
[Linux Mint forum](https://forums.linuxmint.com/viewtopic.php?t=272434), one can
delete `/mnt` if one `wants to` as `long` as the `directory` is `empty`. For
example, `mine` is `empty`, but I'm `not` going to `touch it` anyway.

## /opt

The `/opt` directory is `used` for `optional` add-on `software packages`, or
`anything` that is `not` part of the `base system`. For example, in my `/opt`
directory, I `have` the `following`:

```shell
ls -lh /opt
# returns:
total 4.0K
drwxr-xr-x 8 root root 4.0K Jul 26 00:08 VBoxGuestAdditions-7.0.18
```

`Only` some `distributions` use `/opt`. `Others` use `/usr/local`.

## /proc

`/proc`, aka the `proc filsesystem`, like `/dev`, is a `virtual directory`. It
`contains` special `files` that `provide us` with `information` about our
`computer` such as the `CPU` and the `kernel` our `Linux OS` is `running`. The
`files` and `directories` are `generated` when our `computer starts`, or `on`
the `fly`, `as` our `system` is `running` and `things change`. `/proc` is
`regarded` as the `information` and `control center` of the `Linux` kernel.

The `proc filesystem` is `removed` once the `system` is `powered off`. It is
`mounted` at `/proc mount point` during the `booting process`.

## /root

The `/root` directory, as `opposed` to `/`, `contains` the `following` in my
`Linux Mint OS`:

```shell
ls -lah /root
# which returns:
total 28K
drwx------  4 root root 4.0K Jul 25 23:51 .
drwxr-xr-x 19 root root 4.0K Jul 12 20:46 ..
-rw-r--r--  1 root root 3.1K Oct 15  2021 .bashrc
drwx------  2 root root 4.0K Jan  9  2024 .cache
-rw-r--r--  1 root root  161 Jul  9  2019 .profile
drwx------  3 root root 4.0K Jul 25 23:53 .synaptic
-rw-------  1 root root 1.3K Jul 21 19:37 .viminfo
```

The `root` (`/`) `directory`, mentioned previously, `represents` the `root` of
the `Linux` filesystem. It is `under` this `root` directory that `all` other
`files` and `directories` reside. `On` the `other hand`, the `/root` directory
is the `home` directory for the `root` user. The `/root` contains the `files` we
`created` when `we` were `root` user `and also` the `hidden configuration` files
for some `applications` or `packages` we `installed`. For example, I `installed`
the `vim` text editor, and now `/root` contains a `file` called `.viminfo`.

The `.viminfo` file is
[used to store](https://vimhelp.org/starting.txt.html#viminfo):

```shell
- The command line history.
- The search string history.
- The input-line history.
- Contents of non-empty registers.
- Marks for several files.
- File marks, pointing to locations in files.
- Last search/substitute pattern (for 'n' and '&').
- The buffer list.
- Global variables.
```

## /run

`/run` is a `temporary filesystem` that contains `volatile runtime data` that
`shows` what the `system` has `since` it was `booted`. `Files` under the `/run`
directory `must` be `deleted` (`removed` or `truncated` for `convenience`) `at`
the `start` of the `boot process`.

When I run `ls /run` the `following` is `returned` in `Terminal`:

```shell
acpid.pid             cups             lvm              speech-dispatcher
acpid.socket          dbus             mount            sudo
agetty.reload         dmeventd-client  network          systemd
alsa                  dmeventd-server  NetworkManager   tmpfiles.d
avahi-daemon          fsck             openvpn          udev
blkid                 initctl          openvpn-client   udisks2
casper-md5check.json  initramfs        openvpn-server   user
console-setup         irqbalance       plymouth         utmp
credentials           lightdm          pppconfig        uuidd
crond.pid             lightdm.pid      samba            VBoxDRMClient
crond.reboot          lock             sendsigs.omit.d  zed.pid
cryptsetup            log              shm              zed.state
```

## /sbin

`/sbin` is `similar` to `/bin`, but it `contains applications` that only the
`superuser` needs. We can `use` these `applications` with the `sudo` command
that `provides us` with `superuser powers` on `many distributions`. `/sbin`
typically `contains tools` that can `install things`, `delete things` and
`format things`. `Some` of these `instructions` are `lethal` if we `don't` use
them `properly`, so we `should` handle `them` very `carefully`.

### /usr/sbin

`/usr/sbin` contains `executable programs`,` mostly used` by
`system administrators`, `usually` the `superuser`. `These programs` require
`root permissions`.

## /srv

`/srv` contains `data` for `servers`. My `/srv` directory is `empty`, but then I
have `not` yet `tried` to `set up` a `server`. I `have`, `however`, installed
`node.js` and will be `testing out` creating `simple servers` with it
`re-building` projects I have `created` on `macOS` to quickly `see` what the
`similarities` are `and` the `differences` in the `build process`.

## /swapfile

`/swapfile` is a `swap space partition` which is either `configured by` the
`user` or `system installer`. `Such` a `partition` is `dedicated` to `swapping`.
It may be `slightly faster` than `using` a `swapfile`, `which` is `just` a
`regular` file `inside` our `directory tree` (`and` likely `stored` in the
`root` folder) if it is on the `same disk` as the `operating system`. The `size`
of my `swapfile partition` is `slightly bigger` than `2GB`, which is
`pretty large`.

When I run `ls -lah /swapfile`, the `following` is `returned`:

```shell
-rw------- 1 root 2.06 Jul 12 Jul 12 20:38 /swapfile
```

## /sys

`/sys` is another `virtual` directory like` /proc` and `/dev` and also
`contains information` from `devices connected` to our `computer`. In some cases
we can also `manipulate` those `devices`. But to do that we `have` to become
`superuser`. The `reason` for that is, as with so many other `virtual`
directories, `messing` with the `contents` and `files` in `/sys` can be
`dangerous` and we can `destroy` our `system`. `Writing` to these `files` may or
may `not` write to the `actual device`, `depending` on the `setting` we're
`changing`. It `isn't only` for `managing devices`, but it is `mostly used` for
`that`.

When I run `ls /sys`, the `following` is `returned`:

```shell
block   class   devices   fs          kernel  power
bus     dev     firmware  hypervisor  module
```

## /tmp

The `/tmp` directory contains `temporary` files, usually `placed there` by
`applications` that we are `running`. The` files` and `directories` often (not
always) `contain data` that an `application` doesn’t need `right now`, but
`may need` later `on`.

We can `also` use `/tmp` to `store` our `own` temporary `files`. `/tmp` is `one`
of the `few directories` under `/` that we `can` actually `interact`
with` `without`the`need`to become`superuser`.

When I run `ls -lah /tmp`, the `following` is `returned`:

```shell

```

## /usr

The `/usr` directory is `one` of the `most important` directories `because` it
`contains` all `user binaries`, their `documentation`, `libraries`,
`header files`, etc. `User programs` like `telnet`, `ftp`, etc. also
`reside here`. Originally, `/usr` was `where` the `home` directories of the
`users` were `placed` (`/usr/someone` was `then` the `directory` `now` known as
`/home/someone`). `/usr` is where `user` programs and data (as `opposed` to
'system' programs and data) are. The name hasn't changed, but it's `meaning` has
`narrowed` and `lengthened` from `"everything user related"` to
`"user usable programs and data"`.

When I run `ls -lah /usr`, the `following` is `returned`:

```shell
total 136K
drwxr-xr-x  12 root root 4.0K Jan  9  2024 .

drwxr-xr-x   6 root root 4.0K Jul 26 00:06 src
```

## /var

The `/var` directory `originally` got its `name` because its `contents` was
considered `variable`, because it `changed frequently`. Today the `name` is a
bit `misleading`, because there are many `other directories` that `also` contain
`data` that `changes frequently`, especially `virtual` directories such as
`/proc`, `/sys`, and `/dev`, for example.

`/var` contains `things` like `logs` in the `/var/log` sub-directories. `Logs`
are `files` that `register events` that `happen` on the `system`. `If` something
`fails` in the `kernel`, it `will` be `logged` in a `file` in `/var/log`, `If`
someone `tries` to `break` into `our computer` from `outside`,` our firewall`
will also `log` the `attempt` in `/var`. It also contains `spools` for `tasks`.
These `“tasks”` can be the `jobs` we `send` to a `shared printer` when the
`task` is `queued`, because `another user` is `printing` a `long document`, or
`mail` that is `queued` to be `delivered` to `users` on the `system`.

When I run `ls -lah /var`, the `following` is `returned`:

```shell
total 44K
drwxr-xr-x 11 root root   4.0K Jan  9  2024 .

**[^1]**: Device nodes, aka devices, are the files that the kernel,
applications, and even command-line tools use when they need to access the
hardware.

**[^2]**: I/O (input/output) system calls are calls that a program makes to the
system kernel to provide services the program does not have direct access to.
Examples are providing access to `stdin` devices such as keyboards and stdout
devices such as a terminal window/screen.

**[^3]**: Storage controllers connect disk drives to a computer. In the context
of virtual machines, they are used to access virtual disks, CD/DVD-ROM, and SCSI
devices. An scsi controller is a type of storage controller.

**[^4]**: An ISO image (.iso) a CD-ROM image saved in ISO-9660 format. ISO
images are mainly used as source files from which to create CDs. As an example,
most distributions of Linux release ISO images of the installation CDs. These
images are usually freely available online. --
