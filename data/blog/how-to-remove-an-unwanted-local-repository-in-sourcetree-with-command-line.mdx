So you may ask yourself *“What is the big deal about removing an unwanted repository in [Sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) with `Command Line`"*?
***I mean***, ***like***, *"I remove unwanted local repositories all the time!”* Well, the ***kind***
of ***unwanted*** `local repository` I’m ***talking about*** is the ***kind*** that `incorporates` ***all*** the ***files*** on `your computer`. *“But how is that possible?”* you ***may ask***. I’ll ***tell you***.

I am ***still*** fairly new to [Sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/), but have
become ***much more familiar*** with it as a ***result*** of a `“brain fart”` I ***experienced***
last week. I ***forgot*** to `drag` the `folder` I ***wanted*** to `track` into the
[Sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) `bookmarks window`. ***Instead***, I
***created*** a ***new*** `repository` ***directly*** in the `bookmarks window`.

***Take*** a ***look*** at the `image` of the [Sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/)
`bookmarks window` ***located above***. ***There***, you will ***see*** a `tab` ***called*** `“New Repository”`. If you ***create*** a `repository` in ***that way***, you will ***also*** be ***creating*** a `local git` (or `mercurial`) ***repository*** at the ***same time***, AND it will ***by default*** `create` a `path` ***from*** your `home directory`. ***And*** as we ***all know***, that is where ***all*** the `files` on our c`omputer` ***reside***! I ***had*** a `brain fart` and ***created*** my `repository` in this way ***instead*** of ***dragging*** a `folder` ***from*** `one` of my `local installs` ***into*** the `bookmarks window`. When you ***drag*** a `folder` ***into*** the `bookmarks window`, [Sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) ***immediately recognizes*** the `path` to ***that folder***, which is ***really cool***. ***Not*** `so cool` when you ***inadvertently create*** the `repository` ***within*** the `bookmarks window`.

So ***what*** is a ***girl*** to ***do*** when her `whole computer` ***resides*** in a
[Sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) ***repository***? ***First*** of ***all***, I ***did***
NOTHING ***with*** `this repository`. ***Luckily***, I ***immediately realized*** my `mistake`.
***Luckily***, I ***realized*** that I ***shouldn’t take*** `any kind` of `action`. In ***other words***, I ***shouldn’t*** `track anything`. I ***shouldn’t*** `commit anything`. I ***should do*** NOTHING ***until*** I ***learned how*** to ***get rid*** of it. That was the ***only thing*** to ***do*** here. And I ***also knew*** that I ***had*** to ***exhibit*** `extreme patience`. I ***knew*** that ***there was*** definitely a ***way out*** of ***my dilemma***. I ***just didn’t know*** `how` to ***get out*** of it ***myself***. I ***left*** a
***message*** on the [Atlassian Forums](https://community.atlassian.com/) ***regarding*** my
***dilemma***, and I ***RSVPed*** to a [Hacker Hours](https://www.meetup.com/hackerhours/)
***meetup*** (which I attended yesterday) ***just*** in ***case***.

I ***didn’t receive*** any `response` to ***my dilemma*** from `Atlassian Support`. I
***received*** an `automated message` ***indicating receipt*** of ***my email***, but ***that*** was ***it***. I ***received*** a `response` ***from someone*** `in` the `Forums` ***with*** a ***possible solution***, but was ***not able*** to ***respond*** to ***his response***! I ***had made*** a `total combination` of ***3 questions/comments*** in the ***Forums***, so I ***wasn’t able*** to ***initiate*** any more ***activity*** there ***until*** I ***accumulated*** `25 points`. `“How retarded is that?”` I ***told myself***. I ***had*** this ***major issue*** I ***had*** to ***resolve***, and there was ***no way*** for me to ***communicate*** `with anyone` in the ***Forum***! I ***prayed hard*** that `someone` would ***be able*** to ***help me*** at `Hacker Hours`.

***Lo*** and ***behold***, I ***overheard*** a ***conversation*** about `Command Line` going on ***behind me*** during [Hacker Hours](https://www.meetup.com/hackerhours/), and I ***knew*** that I
***was in*** the ***right place***. `Jasmine`, the ***meetup lead***, ***showed*** me ***how*** to get ***rid of*** the ***local*** `.git` I had ***inadvertently created*** with my `home directory` in
[Sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) ***using*** `Command Line`:

```shell
rm -rf .git
```

***Basically***, ***this*** `command` gets ***rid of*** the ***local*** `.git` ***folder*** that’s ***created*** when you ***create local*** `.git` ***repositories***. When you get ***rid of*** this ***folder***, [Sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) will ***no longer*** `recognize` the
`repository` ***associated*** with ***that folder***. The `downside` is that ***if*** you ***have other*** `local repositories` that you ***have created*** in the ***same location***, you will ***lose them*** as well. What ***made it*** so ***easy*** for ***me*** to get ***rid of*** my ***local*** `.git` ***repository*** was that I ***hadn’t tracked*** any `files`, and I ***hadn’t committed*** `anything`. ***In addition***, I ***hadn’t*** created ***any other*** local `.git` ***repositories*** on `my computer`. ***Only*** `this one`. ***All*** my ***other repositories*** were ***created*** via `drag` and `drop`, and therefore were ***not local*** `.git` ***repositories***. They were ***just*** `local repositories` that I ***hadn’t connected*** to ***any*** `remote repositories` ***either***.

I ***took away*** a ***couple*** of ***very*** `important things` from this ***experience***:

-   `Be patient`. ***Being impatient*** or ***impulsive*** will ***only lead*** to `disaster`. If you
    ***aren’t sure*** about ***how*** to ***rectify*** a ***situation***, `wait` ***until*** you ***come across*** the `sure fire` ***solution***. ***Better yet***, `wait` ***until*** you ***come across*** an ***opportunity*** to ***resolve*** your ***issue*** `face-to-face` with ***people*** who ***know*** what they ***are doing***.

-   If you are `lucky enough` to ***immediately recognize*** that you’ve ***made*** a ***mistake***,
    DON’T DO ANYTHING. Just ***let*** the `repository` ***sit there*** until you have the
    ***appropriate knowledge*** to ***remove*** it. ***Don’t*** be ***tempted*** to `track anything` ***just because***. ***Don’t*** be ***tempted*** to `commit anything` ***just because***. Just ***forget about*** it, ***just because***!
