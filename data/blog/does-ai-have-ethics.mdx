The other day, `Eleftheria Batsou`, community manager at `hashnode`, ***asked*** `“What’s your opinion on the ethics of artifical intelligence?"` on `Twitter`. A ***very good*** question, ***btw***.

***When*** I ***saw*** it, I ***had*** to ***respond***, and it ***was*** the ***following***:

>Inherently there are no ethics. AI has no ethics. There in lies one of the many dangers. Everyone right now is viewing it and using it like the "cool new toy". Anyone remember War Games? Matthew Broderick thought he was playing a game with a harmless computer. the problem is many don't know their "real" history. I could go on and on. I'm not saying it should be "stopped" completely. And neither is it possible. The Pandora's box was opened a long time ago and there is no way to trap it in again. Just be wise and think things through. Not by the "seat of one's pants" so to speak. We have to think through the development process of software. Or the "development" of anything else for that matter. We don't just throw something together without thinking. So why should this be any different? Peopel's "thinking" right now is non-existent and chaotic.  What an irony.

To ***view*** the ***complete thread*** on `Twitter`, please ***visit*** [What's your opinion on the ethics of artificial intelligence?](https://twitter.com/BatsouElef/status/1643114924359442432).

***What*** is `YOUR` ***opinion*** on the `ethics` of `AI`? And ***do*** you ***think*** that we ***should approach*** `AI` in a more `“orchestrated”` and `“organized”` ***fashion***, ***thinking*** things ***through***, ***instead*** of in a `“by the seat of one’s pants”` ***manner***? And ***what*** do you ***think*** about `AI` in the ***first place***? And ***finally***, do you ***feel comfortable*** `using` a ***tool*** you ***don’t understand***, and ***especially*** the ***consequences*** of ***such*** a ***tool***?
