## Introducing autonated testing

### What is automated testing?

`Automated testing` is a `software` testing `technique` that `validates` the
`functionality` of `software` and `ensures` it `meets` certain `requirements`
before it's `released` into `production`.

### What are automated tests?

`Tests` which `are` regularly `executed` (usually `executed` in `Terminal`) to
`check` whether our `code` is `operating` as `expected`.

`Some tests` might `apply` to a `particular model`. `Some` might `apply` to the
`overall functionality` of the `software`, i.e., `does` a `sequence` of
`user inputs` on the `site` produce the `expected result`?

The `difference` between `automated` and `manual tests` is `that` the
`automated` testing `work` is `done` for `us` by the `system`. We `create` a
`set` of tests `once`, and `then` as we `make changes` to our `app`, `we` can
`check` that our `code` still `works` as we `originally intended`, without
`having` to `perform` time `consuming` manual `testing`.

### So why create tests?

1.  **Quality Assurance**:
    -   **Catch Bugs Early**: Tests `help` identify `errors` and
        `unexpected behavior` in our `code` before `they` reach `production`,
        `saving time` and `headaches` down the `line`.
    -   **Ensure Functionality**: Tests `verify` that `our` code `works` as
        `intended`, providing `confidence` in its `correctness` and
        `reliability`.
    -   **Prevent Regressions**: `When` making `changes` to our code, tests
        `act` as a `safety net`, `ensuring` that `existing functionality`
        doesn't `break`.
1.  **Development Efficiency**:
    -   **Faster Debugging**: Tests `pinpoint` the `exact location` of `errors`,
        making `debugging` much `faster` and `more efficient`.
    -   **Improved Code Design**: `Writing` tests `forces us` to `think about`
        our `code`'s `structure` and `interfaces`, `leading` to `better design`
        and `maintainability`.
    -   **Confident Refactoring**: `With` a `comprehensive` test `suite`, `we`
        can `refactor` our `code` with `confidence`, `knowing` that our `tests`
        will `catch` any `unintended consequences`.
1.  **Documentation**:
    -   **Living Documentation**: Tests `serve` as a `form` of `documentation`,
        `illustrating` how our `code` is `intended` to be `used` and `what` its
        `expected` outputs `are`.
    -   **Improved Collaboration**: `Tests` help `team` members `understand` the
        `codebase` and `work together` more `effectively`.
1.  **Professionalism**:
    -   **Industry Standard**: `Testing` is an `industry` standard `practice`,
        and `having` a `well-tested codebase` demonstrates our `professionalism`
        and `commitment` to `quality`.
    -   **Attract Developers**: `Developers` are `more likely` to `contribute`
        to `projects` with `good` test `coverage`, `as` it `shows` that the
        `code` is `well-maintained` and `reliable`.

### Basic testing strategies

`According` to `Geeks for Geeks` in their `post` entitled
[Software Testing Strategies](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-testing-strategies/),

> Software testing is the process of evaluating a software application to
> identify if it meets specified requirements and to identify any defects.

The `strategies` they `list` are the `following`:

1. **Black box testing**: Tests the functionality of the software without
   looking at the internal code structure.
1. **White box testing**: Tests the internal code structure and logic of the
   software.
1. **Unit testing**: Tests individual units or components of the software to
   ensure they are functioning as intended.
1. **Integration testing**: Tests the integration of different components of the
   software to ensure they work together as a system.
1. **Functional testing**: Tests the functional requirements of the software to
   ensure they are met.
1. **System testing**: Tests the complete software system to ensure it meets the
   specified requirements.
1. **Acceptance testing**: Tests the software to ensure it meets the customer’s
   or end-user’s expectations.
1. **Regression testing**: Tests the software after changes or modifications
   have been made to ensure the changes have not introduced new defects.
1. **Performance testing**: Tests the software to determine its performance
   characteristics such as speed, scalability, and stability.
1. **Security testing**: Tests the software to identify vulnerabilities and
   ensure it meets security requirements.

Geeks for Geeks' article
[Software Testing Strategies](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-testing-strategies/)
is `worth` the `read`. Got to
[Software Testing Strategies](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-testing-strategies/)
to `learn more`.

## Writing our first test

### Identifying a bug

`There` is a `little bug` in the `polls application` for `us` to `fix` right
away. The `Question.recently_published()` method returns `True` if the
`Question` was `published` within the `last day` (`which` is `correct`) but
`also` if the `Question`’s `pub_date` field is `in` the `future` (`which` it
`isn’t`).

`We` can `confirm` the `bug` by first `running` the following `command` in
`Terminal`:

```shell
python manage.py shell
```

And then:

```shell
# the following is returned
Python 3.12.0 (v3.12.0:0fb18b02c8, Oct  2 2023, 09:45:56) [Clang 13.0.0 (clang-1300.0.29.30)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
(InteractiveConsole)
>>> import datetime
>>> from django.utils import timezone
>>> from polls.models import Question
>>> future_question = Question(pub_date=timezone.now() + datetime.timedelta(days=30))
>>> future_question.recently_published()
True
>>>
```

**Note**: I changed `was_published_recently()` to `recently_published()` when we
`first created` the `related code`.

`Since things` in the `future` are `not recent`, this `code` is `wrong`.

### Creating a test to expose the bug

What `we` just `did` in the `shell` is `what` we `can do` in an
`automated test`, so `we` are `now` going to `transform` that `into` a `test`.

I `like `to `create` a `tests` directory `inside` my `app` directories, so I
`created` a `directory` called `tests` inside the `polls` directory. Inside
`tests`, `I` also `had` to create a `__init__.py` file. `Otherwise`, the `test`
module would `not` be `recognized` and the `test` command `would` not `work`.
`Test` it `out` for `yourself` to `see` what `happens`.

Then, `inside` that `directory`, I `created` a `file` called
`test_question_model_tests.py`. `Inside` that `file`, I `added` the `following`:

```python
import datetime
from django.test import TestCase
from django.utils import timezone
from polls.models import Question

class QuestionModelTests(TestCase):
    def test_recently_published_with_future_question(self):
        """
        recently_published() returns False for questions whose pub_date
        is in the future.
        """
        time = timezone.now() + datetime.timedelta(days=30)
        future_question = Question(pub_date=time)
        self.assertIs(future_question.recently_published(), False)
```

`Then` I `ran` the `following command`:

```shell
python3 manage.py test polls.tests.test_question_model_tests
```

Which `returned` the `following`:

```shell
Found 1 test(s).
Creating test database for alias 'default'...
System check identified no issues (0 silenced).
F
======================================================================
FAIL: test_recently_published_with_future_question (polls.tests.test_question_model_tests.QuestionModelTests.test_recently_published_with_future_question)
recently_published() returns False for questions whose pub_date
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/Users/mariacam/Python-Development/django-polls/polls/tests/test_question_model_tests.py", line 14, in test_recently_published_with_future_question
    self.assertIs(future_question.recently_published(), False)
AssertionError: True is not False

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 1 test in 0.000s

FAILED (failures=1)
Destroying test database for alias 'default'...
```

`If`, `however`, you `follow` the `Django` official` tutorial` exactly, and
create `tests.py` in `polls` (`polls/test.py`), `you` would `run` the
`following` command `instead`:

```shell
python3 manage.py test polls
```

`What` my command `did` was the `following`:

1. It `looked` for a `test` in the `polls/tests/test_question_model_test.py`
   file.
1. It `found` a `subclass` of the `django.test.TestCase` class
1. It `created` a `special database` for the `purpose` of `testing`
1. It `looked` for `test methods` - `ones` whose `names` begin with `test`.
   `That` is `why` I `called` my file `test_question_model_tests.py`. `That way`
   it would `get` picked `up`.
1. in `test_recently_published_with_future_question` it `created` a `Question`
   instance `whose` pub_date `field` is `30 days` in the `future`.
1. `Using` the `assertIs()` method, it `discovered` that its
   `recently_published()` returned `True`, `but` we `wanted it` to return
   `False`

`The` test `tells` us `which` test `failed` and `the` line `where` the `failure`
occurred.

### Fixing the bug

`In order` to `fix` the `bug`, we `have` to `refactor` the
`Question.recently_published()` function in `polls.models.py` so `that` it will
`only` return `True` if the `date` is `in` the `past`:

```python
# polls/models.py
from django.db import models
import datetime
from django.utils import timezone


# Create your models here.
class Question(models.Model):
    question_text = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    pub_date = models.DateTimeField("date published")  # human readable name

    def recently_published(self):
        now = timezone.now()
        return now - datetime.timedelta(days=1) <= self.pub_date <= now

    def __str__(self):
        return self.question_text


class Choice(models.Model):
    question = models.ForeignKey(Question, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    choice_text = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    votes = models.IntegerField(default=0)

    def __str__(self):
        return self.choice_text
```

`Next`, we `run` the `test` again:

```shell
python3 manage.py test polls.tests.test_question_model_tests
```

`And` the `following` is `returned`:

```shell
Found 1 test(s).
Creating test database for alias 'default'...
System check identified no issues (0 silenced).
.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 1 test in 0.000s

OK
Destroying test database for alias 'default'...
```

`Now` the `test` passed!

## Creating more comprehensive tests for Question.recently_published()

`Next`, we `add` two `more tests` to `test` the `behavior` of the
recently_published() method `more comprehensively`:

```python
# polls/tests/test_question_model_tests.py
import datetime
from django.test import TestCase
from django.utils import timezone
from polls.models import Question

class QuestionModelTests(TestCase):
    def test_recently_published_with_future_question(self):
        """
        recently_published() returns False for questions whose pub_date
        is in the future.
        """
        time = timezone.now() + datetime.timedelta(days=30)
        future_question = Question(pub_date=time)
        self.assertIs(future_question.recently_published(), False)

    def test_recently_published_with_old_question(self):
        """
        recently_published() returns False for questions whose pub_date
        is older than 1 day.
        """
        time = timezone.now() - datetime.timedelta(days=1, seconds=1)
        old_question = Question(pub_date=time)
        self.assertIs(old_question.recently_published(), False)


    def test_recently_published_with_recent_question(self):
        """
        recently_published() returns True for questions whose pub_date
        is within the last day.
        """
        time = timezone.now() - datetime.timedelta(hours=23, minutes=59, seconds=59)
        recent_question = Question(pub_date=time)
        self.assertIs(recent_question.recently_published(), True)
```

## Testing a view

`According` to the `Django` tutorial `part 5`,

> The polls application is fairly undiscriminating: it will publish any
> question, including ones whose pub_date field lies in the future. We should
> improve this. Setting a pub_date in the future should mean that the Question
> is published at that moment, but invisible until then.
>
> When we fixed the bug above, we wrote the test first and then the code to fix
> it. In fact that was an example of test-driven development, but it doesn’t
> really matter in which order we do the work.

## Analyzing the tools available to us in testing

### The Django test client

Django `provides` a test `Client` to `simulate` a `user` interacting `with` the
`code` at the `view level `(`frontend`). `We` can `use it` in
`test_question_model_tests.py` or `even` in the `shell`.

We'll `start` with the `shell`:

```shell
python3 manage.py shell
Python 3.12.0 (v3.12.0:0fb18b02c8, Oct  2 2023, 09:45:56) [Clang 13.0.0 (clang-1300.0.29.30)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
(InteractiveConsole)
>>> from django.test.utils import setup_test_environment
>>> setup_test_environment()
>>>
```

`setup_test_environment()` installs a `template renderer` which will `let` us
`examine` some additional `attributes` on `responses` such as `response.context`
that `otherwise` would `not` be `available`. `However`, this `method` does not
`set up` a `test database`, `so` what `follows` will `test` against the
`existing database`. The `output` might `differ` slightly `depending` on
`what questions` we `already created`.

`Next`, we `need` to `import` the `test client` (`later` in
`test_question_model_tests.py` we will `use` the `django.test.TestCase` class,
which `comes with` its own `client`, so this `won’t` be `required`):

```shell
>>> from django.test import Client
# create an instance of the client for our use
>>> client = Client()
# get a response from '/'
>>> response = client.get('/')
Not Found: /
# we should expect a 404 from that address. If you instead see an "Invalid HTTP_HOST header" error and a 400 response, you probably omitted the setup_test_environment() call described earlier.
>>> response.status_code
404
# on the other hand we should expect to find something at '/polls/' we'll use 'reverse()' rather than a hardcoded URL
>>> from django.urls import reverse
>>> response.client.get(reverse("polls:index")) # this is extra!
<TemplateResponse status_code=200, "text/html; charset=utf-8">
>>> response = client.get(reverse("polls:index"))
>>> response.status_code
200
>>> response.content
b'<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n    <meta charset="UTF-8">\n    <meta name="description" content="This is the Django Polls Home Page.">\n    <meta name="keywords" content="Django, Python, polls, questions, choices, votes">\n    <title>Django Polls Home Page</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n\n  <p>No polls available.</p>\n\n\n</body>\n</html>\n'
>>> response.context["latest_question_list"]
# Expected QuerySet as per tutorial is not returned.
```

When I `added` a `second question`, and `re-ran` all the `above`, I `did` get
`back` a `QuerySet` at the `end`:

```shell
>>> response.context["latest_question_list"]
<QuerySet [<Question: Is it safe?>, <Question: What's the problem?>]>
```

## Improving our PollsIndexView

`Right now` our `PollsIndexView` looks `like` the `following`:

```python
class PollsIndexView(ListView):
    template_name = "polls/index.html"
    context_object_name = "latest_question_list"

    def get_queryset(self):
        """Return the last five published questions."""
        Question.objects.order_by("pub_date")[:5]
```

We `need` to `change` the `get_queryset()` method so `that` it `also checks` the
`date` by `comparing` it with `timezone.now()`:

```python
from django.utils import timezone

class PollsIndexView(ListView):
    template_name = "polls/index.html"
    context_object_name = "latest_question_list"

    def get_queryset(self):
        """
        Return the last five published questions (not including those set to be
        published in the future).
        """
        return Question.objects.filter(pub_date__lte=timezone.now()).order_by("-pub_date")[
        :5]
```

`Question.objects.filter(pub_date__lte=timezone.now())` returns a `queryset`
containing `Questions` whose `pub_date` is `less than` or `equal to`, that is,
`earlier than` or `equal` to `timezone.now()`.

## Testing our new view

```python
def create_question(question_text, days):
    """
    Create a question with the given `question_text` and published the
    given number of `days` offset to now (negative for questions published
    in the past, positive for questions that have yet to be published).
    """
    time = timezone.now() + datetime.timedelta(days=days)
    return Question.objects.create(question_text=question_text, pub_date=time)

class QuestionIndexViewTests(TestCase):
    def test_no_questions(self):
        """
        If no questions exist, an appropriate message is displayed.
        """
        response = self.client.get(reverse("polls:index"))
        self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 200)
        self.assertContains(response, "No polls available.")
        self.assertQuerySetEqual(response.context["latest_question_list"], [])

    def test_past_question(self):
        """
        Questions with a pub_date in the past are displayed on the
        index page.
        """
        question = create_question(question_text="Past question.", days=-30)
        response = self.client.get(reverse("polls:index"))
        print(response, "test past question")
        print(response.context["latest_question_list"], [question], 'response context!')
        self.assertQuerySetEqual(response.context["latest_question_list"], [question],)

    def test_future_question(self):
        """
        Questions with a pub_date in the future aren't displayed on
        the index page.
        """
        create_question(question_text="Future question.", days=30)
        response = self.client.get(reverse("polls:index"))
        print(response, "the response!")
        self.assertContains(response, "No polls available.")
        self.assertQuerySetEqual(response.context["latest_question_list"], [])

    def test_future_question_and_past_question(self):
        """
        Even if both past and future questions exist, only past questions
        are displayed.
        """
        question = create_question(question_text="Past question.", days=-30)
        create_question(question_text="Future question.", days=30)
        response = self.client.get(reverse("polls:index"))
        self.assertQuerySetEqual(response.context["latest_question_list"], [question])

    def two_past_questions(self):
        """
        The questions index page may display multiple questions.
        """
        question1 = create_question(question_text="Past question 1.", days=-30)
        question2 = create_question(question_text="Past question 2.", days=-5)
        response = self.client.get(reverse("polls:index"))
        self.assertQuerySetEqual(response.context["latest_question_list"], [question2, question1],)
```

When `I` run `python3 manage.py test polls.tests.test_question_model_tests`, the
`following` is `returned`:

```shell
Found 7 test(s).
Creating test database for alias 'default'...
System check identified no issues (0 silenced).

....
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 7 tests in 0.012s

OK
Destroying test database for alias 'default'...
```

All `the` tests `passed`!

1. `create_question` was `created` to `remove` some `of` the `code repetition`
   regarding `creating` a `question`.
1. `test_no_questions` doesn't `return` anything. `It` just `checks` for
   `"No polls available."` in the `response object` and `verifies` that
   `'latest_question_list'` is `empty`.
1. `django.test.TestCase` provides `some` more `assertion` methods such as
   `assertContains()` and `assertQuerySetEqual`.
1. `test_past_question` tests `whether` a `question` published `in` the `past`
   is `displayed` on the `index` page.
1. `test_future_question` tests to `make sure` that `questions` published `in`
   the `future` aren't `displayed` on the `index` page `now`.
1. `test_future_question_and_past_question` tests to `make sure` that `even` if
   both `past` and `future questions` have been `created`, `only` past
   `questions` are `displayed` on the `index` page.
1. `two_past_questions` checks to `make sure` multiple `questions` are
   `displayed` on the `index` page.

## Testing the PollsDetailView

`The` PollsDetailView `consists` of the `following`:

```python
class PollsDetailView(DetailView):
    model = Question
    template_name = "polls/detail.html"
```

`Next`, I `added` the `following` to `polls/tests/test_question_model_tests.py`:

```python
class QuestionDetailViewTests(TestCase):
    def test_future_question(self):
        """
        The detail view of a question with a pub_date in the future
        returns a 404 not found.
        """
        future_question = create_question(question_text="Future question.", days=5)
        url = reverse("polls:detail", args=(future_question.id,))
        response = self.client.get(url)
        self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 404)

    def test_past_question(self):
        """
        The detail view of a question with a pub_date in the past
        displays the question's text.
        """
        past_question = create_question(question_text="Past Question.", days=-5)
        url = reverse("polls:detail", args=(past_question.id,))
        response = self.client.get(url)
        self.assertContains(response, past_question.question_text)
```

`However`, `when` I `ran` the `QuestionDetailViewTests`, `test_future_question`
failed. `There` was an `Assertion Error` of `200 != 404`. The `test` was
`failing` because the `view` was `returning` a `200 `(`OK`) `status code`
instead `of` the `expected 404`. This `suggested` that the `view` was `not`
correctly `checking` the `pub_date` before `displaying` the `question`.

I `fixed` the `PollsDetailView` with `the` following `code`:

```python
class PollsDetailView(DetailView):
    model = Question
    template_name = "polls/detail.html"

    def get_object(self, queryset=None):
           question = super().get_object(queryset=queryset)
           if question.pub_date > timezone.now():
               raise Http404("Question not yet published")
           return question
```

`Then` I `re-ran` my `tests`, `and` the `following` was `returned` in
`Terminal`:

```shell
Found 10 test(s).
Creating test database for alias 'default'...
System check identified no issues (0 silenced).
..........
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 10 tests in 0.016s

OK
Destroying test database for alias 'default'...
```

`Now` all `the` tests `passed`!

### Breaking down the refactored PollsDetailView

1. My `view` should `have` had `logic` to `check` the `pub_date` and `return` a
   `404` if the `question` is `not` yet `published`. `It` did `not`.
1. My `test` was `good`. Just `PollsDetailView` was `flawed`.
1. `super().get_object()` is `used` to `call` the
   `get_object(queryset=queryset)`. `It` is used `within` class-based `views` to
   `call` the `get_object` method of the `parent class`, `while` optionally
   `providing` a `specific queryset` to `use` for `retrieving` the `object`.
    - `super()` allows `us` to access `methods` and `properties` of a
      `parent class`. `In` the `context` of `Django` class-based `views`, `it's`
      often `used` to `call` methods `from` the `base` view `class` (e.g.,
      `DetailView`, `UpdateView`, etc.) `such` as `here`.
    - `.get_object()` is a `method` defined in `Django`'s generic views
      `mixins`. It's `used` to `retrieve` a `single object` from the `database`
      based `on` the `provided parameters` (`usually` the `primary ke`y).
    - `queryset=queryset` allows `us` to `specify` a `custom queryset` to `use`
      for `retrieving` the `object`. If `we` don't `provide` this `argument`,
      the `default queryset` of the `model` associated `with` the `view` will
      `be used`. `In` our `case`, we `have` a `custom queryset` in `the` parent
      `PollsIndexView`, `so` we should `pass` in `queryset=queryset`.

**Explanation**:

1. `Our` PollsDetailView `represents` a `custom` DetailView `class`.
1. `The` default `get_object` method is `overridden` to `allow` for
   `custom logic`.
1. `If` a `queryset` is `provided` as an `argument`, `it` will be `used`.
   `Otherwise`, `the` default `queryset` of the `view` is `obtained` using
   `self.get_queryset()`.
1. The `super().get_object()` method is `called`, `passing` the `queryset`
   argument. `This` ensures `that` the `object` retrieval `logic` is `handled`
   by the `parent class`'s get_object `method`, `but` with the `potentially`
   customized `queryset`.

**Common use case**:

1. **Filtering**: `We` might `use` this `pattern` to `further filter` the
   `queryset` based on `specific conditions`, `such as` the `current user`'s
   `permissions` or `other` request `parameters`. `We` do `that` with
   `our code`. `We` are `filtering` by `date`.

## Sometimes tests need to be updated

`We` can `change` our `views` so `that` only `Questions` with `Choices` are
`published`. `In` that `case,` `many` of our `existing tests` would `fail`. `We`
would be `told` `exactly` which `tests` need `to` be `updated` to `bring` them
`up` to `date`, `so` to `that` extent `tests` help `look` after `themselves`.

`At worst`, `as` we `continue` developing, `we` might `find` that `we` have some
`tests` that `have` become `redundant`. Even t`hat`’s not a `problem`. In
`testing`, `redundancy` is a `good thing`.

**Good testing practice includes the following**:

1. `A` separate `TestClass` for `each model` or `view`.
1. A `separate` test `method` for `each set` of `conditions` we `want` to
   `test`.
1. `Test` method `names` that `describe` their `function`.

## Conclusion

In this section, we were introduced to automated testing. We discussed what
automated testing is, why it's important to create tests, basic testing
strategies, wrote our first test to identify a bug, fixed the bug, created more
comprehensive tests for Question.recently_published(), tested a view, analyzed
the tools available to us in testing, were introduced to the Django test client,
improved our PollsIndexView, tested our new PollsIndexView, tested the
PollsDetailView, and broke down the refactored PollsDetailView (which originally
contained a bug which I fixed).
