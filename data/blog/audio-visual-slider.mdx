_Audio Visual Slider_

An application I created at the `height` of the `COVID-19 pandemic` as part of
the `course content` of a `Dynamic Web 1` (`JavaScript`) `course` I was
`teaching`. We had just `migrated` to `online learning`, and I wanted to create
an application that visualized what we were all feeling. I selected images that
expressed those feelings, and `synched` the `animations` with the `beat` of
`music` I chose. It was a rough time, but my students for that class were really
amazing. I was truly inspired by them.
