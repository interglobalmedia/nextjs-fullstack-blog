I `run` my `Linux Mint` distribution in `VirtualBox`, so the
`virtual disk space` I have `allocated` to `it` is `not` as much `as` I
`would like`. i `want` to be `able` to have `hard disk space` allocated to my
`Windows 11 partition` as well. So that `means` that I `should` be `monitoring`
the `disk space` that `Linux Mint` in `VirtualBox` is `eating up`. So I
`created` a `cron job` to `do `just `that`.

## Creating the disk_space_alert.sh file

`First`, I `created` an `executable` file called `disk-space_alert.sh` and set
`executable permissions` on `it`:

```shell
chmod +x disk-space_alert.sh
```

`chmod` stands for `change mode`.

Then I `check` to `make sure` that `execute permissions` were `added` to
`disk-space_alert.sh` by `running` the `ls -l` command in `Terminal`, and the
`following` is `returned` as a `result`:

```shell
-rwxrwxr-x 2 maria maria 206 Aug 8 09:12 disk_space_alert.sh
```

## Adding the shell script to disk-space_alert.sh

`Then` I `add` the `following script` to `disk-space_alert.sh`:

```shell
#!/bin/bash

threshold=90
current_usage=$(df -h / | awk 'NR==2 {print $5}' | tr -d '%')

if [ "$current_usage" -ge "$threshold" ]
then
    echo "Disk space is running low!"
else
    echo "Disk space is okay."
fi
```

## The df command

`df` refers to the `disk free` command. The `-h` flag means `human readable`,
and `/` refers to the `root` directory of the `filesystem hierarchy` which the
`df` command `searches through` and returns the percentage of disk used. To
`learn more` about the `filesystem hierarchy`, please `read` my `article`
entitled
[The Linux Filesystem Hierarchy](http://localhost:3000/blog/the-linux-filesystem-hierarchy).

`current_usage=$(df -h /` is `piped` into the `awk` command as `stdin`.

To `learn more` about the `df` command, run `man df` in `Terminal`.

## The awk command

`awk`, or `mawk`, is a `pattern scanning` and `text processing` language. `awk`
is an `interpreter` for the `AWK` programming language. `AWK` stands for
`Aho, Weinberger, and Kernighan`, who were the `designers` of the
`AWK language`, and it `originated` at `AT&T Bell Laboratories` in `1977`.

`NR` stands for `Number Records`, and it is a built-in `awk` variable. It means
`"number of line"` or `"number of current line"`. `NR` keeps a current count of
the number of input records. Records in AWK are usually lines. The 1 command
`performs` the `pattern/action` statements `once` for `each record` in a `file`.

`awk 'NR==2 {print $5}'` means if `NR` is `equal` to `2`, print `field` (or
`column`) `$5`.

Then `awk 'NR==2 {print $5}'` is redirected as stdin to `tr -d '%'`.

## The tr command

The `tr` command `translates`, `squeezes`, and/or `deletes` characters from
`stdin`, `writing` to `stdout`. `STRING1` and `STRING2` specify `arrays` of
`characters`, and `ARRAY1` and `ARRAY2` control the `action`.

tr -d '%' deletes the '%' symbol so that the `value` of `current_usage` is an
`integer`.

## if/else statement

The `meaning` of the `if/else` statement is if `"$current_usage"` is
`greater than or equal to` (`-ge`) "$threshold", `which` is `90`, then
`echo "Disk space is running low!"`, else `echo "Disk space is okay."`

## Adding the disk_space_alert.sh shell script to crontab

Lastly, I add this shell script to the bottom of my crontab file:

```shell
# first I have to run crontab -e in Terminal to open up disk_space_alert.sh
crontab -e
# then I add the following to the bottom of the crontab file
30 06 * * * /home/maria/Desktop/cron-job-scripts/disk_space_alert.sh
```

`After` the `cron job` is `executed`, I will `receive` a `local email` via
`mailx` telling me either `"Disk space is running low!"` or
`"Disk space is okay."`.
