***Last week***, I ***decided*** to ***dive into*** a ***new project***. ***Part*** of the `project` ***entailed*** ***re-using*** `code` I had ***already created***, so I was ***very excited*** about it. **_One of_** my `2017 New Year’s resolutions` was to ***create code*** that I ***would*** be ***able*** to ***re-use*** in ***other modules*** or ***projects***, so I ***welcomed*** the ***opportunity***.

***Some*** `re-usable code` was ***related*** to `cross-browser` ***hacks*** for ***input*** ***ranges***. I had ***already*** done ***quite*** a ***bit*** of ***research*** on the `topic` for my `Custom HTML5 video player`, and the `code` was ***pretty much*** `complete`. So I ***went*** to my `Github` ***profile*** and ***clicked*** on the ***link*** to the [custom-html5-video-player](https://interglobalmedia.github.io/custom-html5-video-player/) `gh-pages` ***website***. ***All*** the `styling` was ***gone***! I ***was*** in a ***panic***. There was a ***high probability*** that ***potential employers***, ***team mates***, or ***colleagues*** had ***visited*** the `repository` in ***this condition***. ***Why*** did it ***happen***, and ***what*** could I ***do*** to ***mitigate*** the ***severity*** of the ***situation***? I ***looked*** over ***all*** the `code` and ***didn’t find*** `anything` at ***first***. ***Then*** I ***had*** a ***sneaking suspicion*** that it ***might have*** had ***something*** to ***do*** with my ***custom*** `favicon`. I ***looked over*** the `markup` of the `index.html` for the ***custom player***. Then the ***following*** `stared` at `me` in the ***face***:

```js
<link rel="icon" href="https://interglobalmedia.github.io/custom-html5-video-player/favicon.ico" /
```

***Were*** you ***able*** to ***catch it*** at ***first glance***? I ***didn’t close*** the `link` ***tag***. The `>` was ***missing***. I **_immediately_** **added it** and **_pushed_** the ***change*** to `Github`. So if you ***visited*** my [Custom HTML5 Video Player](https://github.com/interglobalmedia/custom-html5-video-player) ***repo*** on `Github` in the ***past couple*** of ***weeks***, there was ***no styling***, ***because*** I ***had experienced*** my **_first_** `Amazon S3 moment`, as I ***like*** to ***term*** it. ***See*** `"Amazon S3 moment"` ***tweet text*** below:

>[The Amazon S3 Outage Is What Happens When One Site Hosts Too Much of the Internet](https://t.co/jMLvrVi1gh) | WIRED &mdash; Mark Wityszyn (@Coss4ck) - [March 6, 2017](https://twitter.com/Coss4ck/status/838765117517021185?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

***Perhaps*** the `Amazon S3` ***outage*** was a ***result*** of `one site` hosting ***too much*** of the `internet`, but in ***my case*** it was ***one*** `person` ***adding*** a `favicon` to ***too many*** `projects` in ***one fell swoop***, and ***trying*** to ***get*** it ***done*** as ***quickly*** as ***possible***. ***What did*** I ***learn***? ***Don’t do*** it ***so quickly***. ***Break up*** the ***tedious task*** into ***smaller chunks***. ***Most important***, ***don’t rush***, ***no matter*** how much ***others want*** or ***expect you*** to. One ***has*** to ***find*** a ***balanced*** `middle ground`. ***Trying*** to ***race*** to the ***finish*** more ***often than*** not ***results*** in ***falling behind***. ***Remember*** the ***story*** of the `tortoise` and the `*hare`?

Please **_do visit_** the
[repository](https://github.com/interglobalmedia/custom-html5-video-player) ***now***,
as the `issue` has ***been fixed***, and I am ***very proud*** of ***this project***. I ***even added*** a ***couple*** of ***tweaks*** to ***make*** the `visuals` even ***more appealing***. ***Thanks*** in ***advance*** for your ***patience*** and ***understanding***!
