So why are software updates to nodes (aka devices) on a network vital to their security?

For users, updates improve device performance, stability, and may even result in new features.

As relates to security, updates allow both individuals and organizations to address security vulnerabilities that can place individuals, devices, and networks at risk.  

There are a couple of types of updates related to security.

## patch updates

First, there is the patch update, which can be either a software or system update, and usually relates to security related issues. This is the smallest incremental update. For example, right now my macOS (MacBook Pro) is at Sonoma 14.2.1. The part of the version number that points to the patch update is `".1"`.  

The patch update addresses security vulnerabilities within a program or product. Patches usually consist of bug fixes that address common security vulnerabities and exposures. 

If an individual or organization does not apply patch updates to their operating System (OS), for example, malicious actors can use those gaps in security to gain unauthorized access to a system. Software updates are analogous to "locking" an "unlocked door", thereby fixing vulnerabilities in the software.

## patching zero day vulnerabilities

In the ideal world, patches address common (known) vulnerabilities and exposures BEFORE malicious hackers can find them. However, sometimes patches are created in response to a zero-day, which refers to previously unknown exploits or vulnerabilities.

A good example of a zero day vulnerability is those that were ["exploited in the wild" ](https://www.darkreading.com/cloud-security/google-eighth-zero-day-patch-2023-chrome) in Google Chrome. According to Dark Reading in the article entitled [Google Releases Eighth Zero-Day Patch of 2023 for Chrome](https://www.darkreading.com/cloud-security/google-eighth-zero-day-patch-2023-chrome) by Nathan Eddy,

>CVE-2023-7024, exploited in the wild prior to patching, is a Chrome vulnerability that allows remote code execution within the browser's WebRTC component...Google has issued an urgent update to address a recently discovered vulnerability in Chrome that has been under active exploitation in the wild, marking the eighth zero-day vulnerability identified for the browser in 2023.

Mozilla Firefox also experienced a ["critical" zero day in its browser and email client](https://www.scmagazine.com/news/mozilla-patches-critical-zero-day-that-targeted-its-firefox-browser-and-thunderbird-email-client) in the early fall of 2023.

According to Dark Reading, ["Web browsers remain a top cyber attack target"](https://www.darkreading.com/cloud-security/google-eighth-zero-day-patch-2023-chrome). That makes sense, since just about everyone who has a device that connects to the internet uses a web browser to connect to it. And Google Chrome's [browser market share](https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share) as of December 2023 is 64.73%, and is therefore why it is most targeted. Safari, which is also very popular, takes up 18.56% of the browser market share, Microsoft Edge 4.97%, Firefox 3.36%, Opera 2.86%, and Samsung Internet 2.59%. The more popular the software, the more probable it is a popular target of cyber attacks. 

If users and system administrators fail to regularly update these softwares, they place the security of their systems and networks at risk!

In November 2023, Apple released a security patch update with [macOS Sonoma 14.1.2](https://www.macworld.com/article/2159458/apple-releases-macos-sonoma-14-1-2-to-fix-exploited-zero-day-webkit-flaws.html), which contained a couple of critical Safari security updates addressing WebKit flaws in Safari. These flaws were patched in iOS and iPad version 17.1.2 as well.

Apple released security patches for an [actively exploited iOS zero day flaw](https://thehackernews.com/2023/10/apple-rolls-out-security-patches-for.html) in October 2023. I remember being notifited about it at the time by The Hacker News, and rushing to update both my iPhone and iPad!

And the list goes on and on...

## Automatic vs Manual Updates

When possible, it is a best practice to automatically update software, including browser software. And it is really easy to make that happen. To enable this feature in Firefox (macOS), for example, go into the General tab under Firefox "Settings", and towards the bottom, yuo should see something like the following:

![Set Firefox to automatic updates](Screenshot-2024-01-15-at-11.36.38-AM.jpg)

***Firefox automatic updates located in Settings within the General tab***

In order to set macOS (Sonoma) to automatic updates, go to System Settings in the Apple Menu, then to the General Tab, and then Software Updates. If there are any operating system (OS) related updates available , they will appear there.

***macOS Softare Updates***

If you just want to manually uptate software, you can just turn off Automatic updates. This is not recommended. Automatic updates does not automatically upgrade to new versions of the OS. It only automatically updates incremental versions of the current OS, like security patches and minor updates. The minor update of an OS is the second number in the OS version number, i.e., `".2"` in Sonoma version `14.2.1`. 

The advantage of manual updates is when software updates have not been thoroughly updated by developers, which can lead to instability issues. One way to find out such information is to subscribe to blogs which cover information about the status of macOS software. These updates are also known as "beta" updates.

if you want to automatically update incremental versions of the current OS, set "Automatic Updates" to "On". 

I would not recommend turning on Beta Updates for consumer individuals, as they are not necessarily stable and could cause unexpected issues or OS behaviors.

## Installing updates via the Command Line

There is an easier and faster way of checking for macOS software updates, and it is acbievable through the command line.

In order to check for software updates available on the system, run the following command in Terminal (Command Line):

>softwareupdate -l

Returns [something like the following](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/apple-mac-os-x-update-softwareupdate-bash-shell-command/):

```shell
Software Update Tool

Finding available software
Software Update found the following new or updated software:
* Label: macOS Ventura 13.5-22G74
	Title: macOS Ventura 13.5, Version: 13.5, Size: 3502490K, Recommended: YES, Action: restart,
```

I ran the `softwareupdate -l` command just now, but there were no updates available. The above example was taken from the article entitled [How To Update macOS Using Command Line Software Update Tool](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/apple-mac-os-x-update-softwareupdate-bash-shell-command/) by Vivek Gite on `nixcraft.com`.

If an available update does appear, run the following command to install it:

>softwareupdate -i update_pkg_name

If you are not an administrator of your macOS or do not have administrative privileges on your computer, you will have to add `sudo` to your command:

>sudo softwareupdate -i update_pkg_name

To find out "what's new" or coming up in the macOS ecosystem, you can visit [developer.apple.com/](https://developer.apple.com/). You will have to log in with your Apple credentials.

## Why it's important to upgrade your OS (and your device if necessary)

The third kind of udpate is the OS upgrade. This is also referred to as a major version update. The major version number is the first number in a software version, like the number `14` of Sonoma `14.2.1`,for example. A "major version" refers to an upgrade of the actual system OS. Like when macOS users upgraded from macOS Ventura to macOS Sonoma. This type of update should be done manually, especially if you are not sure whether your device is compatible with it. Apple is constantly updating which devices are compatible with the latest version of OS on their website.

I have had clients that have insisted on keeping their old devices, even if they can no longer update their current OS. But that is highly not recommended. First of all, upgrading the OS keeps your device up to date with the latest and greatest computer programs. But more important, it makes sure that you are not using potentially vulnerable software that is susceptible to all sorts of cyber attacks. 

How? Because malicious actors have access to information about older software and their vulnerabilities, and therefore the necessary software intelligence to exploit those vulnerabilities. 

Devices can also become so outdated that they no longer are compatible with the latest OS or programs. 

Lastly, and most important, if something should go wrong with your device, having an up-to-date OS will halp Tech support experts recover your files. 

Keeping your system(s) current will also enable you to open files received from other people without problems. 

Keeping your system(s) current also means that your files will be SAFER, and your life and work less frightening.
