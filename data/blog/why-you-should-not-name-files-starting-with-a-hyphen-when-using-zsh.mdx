Recently, for kicks, I tried to name a file starting with a hyphen (`-`), and
the following was returned in Terminal:

```shell
touch -file
touch: illegal option -- i
usage: touch [-A [-][[hh]mm]SS] [-achm] [-r file] [-t [[CC]YY]MMDDhhmm[.SS]]
       [-d YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:SS[.frac][tz]] file
```

However, if I try to name my file `file`, I am able to do so. The reason I can't
name files starting with `-` is because of the `-` in one of the zsh
directories. Usually the command line flags are given following a `-`. In the
example above, `-file` is being treated as an illegal option for the `touch`
command. But if I run the following command:

```shell
touch -- -file
```

I am able to successfully create a file named `-file`. Why? Because the `--`
indicates that `-file` is not a flag. However, I do not recommend naming files
(or folders) that start with a hyphen (`-`)!
