I have always opened my `code editors` from the `Command Line` and from within the directory I wanted to open in them using a `shell command`. I did it with `Atom`, I did it with `Sublime`, with `Web Storm`, `PHP Storm`, and now I do it with `VS Code`. I do pretty much everything in `Command Line`. So when someone has a problem with `VS Code` and uses the code editor _**outside**_ of the `Command Line`, I have to _**re-learn**_ how to use `VS Code` in a "different way". I have to take myself back to when I was learning how to use a tool, and I wasn't using the Command Line. It's like _**temporarily**_ retraining your mind. You **can't** think _**instinctively**_. You have to think _**deliberately**_.

Anyhoo, I decided to create a short little `screen recording` in which I show how to use `VS Code` first with the `Command Line` to open a project in
`VS Code` then using `Live Server`, then _**not**_ using the `Command Line`, and then using `Live Server` after opening a `file` instead of a `folder`.
