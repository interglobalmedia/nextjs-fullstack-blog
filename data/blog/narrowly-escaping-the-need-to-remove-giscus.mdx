`Two` of my `posts`, one from several years ago, and one very recent,
**_contain_** `tweets`. However, I was **_not_** initially **_able_** to
`embed tweets` due to the `CSP` **_defined_** in my `next.config.js` file.
**_Initially_**, it **consisted** of the **_following_** (and **_still does_**):

```js
const ContentSecurityPolicy = `
  script-src 'self' 'unsafe-eval' 'unsafe-inline' plausible.io giscus.app;
  img-src * blob: data:;
  media-src 'none';
  connect-src *;
  font-src 'self';
  frame-src giscus.app;
`
```

But I **_wanted_** to **be able** to `embed tweets` using
`platform.twitter.com/widjets.js`. Because of `CSP`, I was **_not able_** to do so **_out of_** the **_box_**. I **_had heard_** that `tweet embeds` did **_not_** perform well with `Next.js` (and **_in general_**), and I **_wanted_** to **_see_** for **myself** what that **_entailed_**, **_before_** I went down **_another route_**.

It **_took_** some **_trial_** and **_error_** to **figure out** how to
**_enable_** `tweet embeds` using `platform.twitter.com/widjets.js`, but I
**_did_** end up **_being successful_**. This **_meant_**, **however**, that I **_had_** to **_remove_** `Giscus` from my `site` **_as well_**. My `CSP` **config** ended up (**_temporarily_**) being the **_following_**:

```js
const ContentSecurityPolicy = `
  script-src 'self' 'unsafe-eval' 'unsafe-inline' plausible.io platform.twitter.com;
  img-src * blob: data:;
  media-src 'none';
  connect-src *;
  font-src 'self';
  frame-src platform.twitter.com;
`
```

The `performance` of my `Twitter` **_tweet embeds_** was `terrible`, just as I had heard. Originally I had **_styled_** the `text` and `links` with a
`blockquote`, and that is **_also_** the `markup` for the` Twitter` **_tweet
embeds_**. So when I would **_land_** on a `post` that **_contained_** a
`tweet embed`, it **_looked like_** one of **_my blockquotes_** and **_not_** a `Twitter` **tweet embed**! I had to **_reload_** the `page` in order for the `embed` to **_render_**. **_What_** was the **_point_** in **_sacrificing_** `Giscus` for a `tweet embed` that **_looked exactly_** `like` my `hack`?

I **_reverted back_** to my **_original_** `CSP` **config**. Then I **_went
on_** to **_research_** my `tweet embed` **_issue_** further.

After some research, I `came across` **_another solution_**: to **_add tweets_** to my `mdx` **posts** in the **_form_** of `static tweets`: `tweets` **_without_** the **use** of `JavaScript`, or **_more precisely_**, **_inline_** `script tags` **_inside_** my `mdx` **posts**.

**_First_** I **came across** an **approach** in which I would **_basically_** be **_creating_** the **_equivalent_** of **_my own_** `static tweet` **plugin**, which **_also happened_** to be **_built_** with `Typescript`, which I do NOT use in my `Next.js` **site**. I **_tried_** to **_refactor_** the `Typescript React` into `JavasScript React`, but **_hit_** a **_wall_** at one point. **_In addition_**, the `structural approach` of `Maxime Heckel`’s `site` **_differed somewhat_** from **_mine_**, so it would have taken **_even longer_** to **_decipher_**. Were **_authentic looking_** `tweet embeds` THAT IMPORTANT to me to **_spend_** so much time on **_at this point_** in the **game**? Honestly, **_no_**. I also had **_too many_** other **_things_** on **_my plate_** to **_deal with_**. I was **_going_** to **_leave_** that `implementation` to **_another_** and **_more propitious_** `time`.

But **_then_** I came across an `npm module` called ‘react-static-tweets’`, and **_decided_** to **give it** a **_shot_**. It DOES work. On **_initial load_**, in a `post` that contains **_only one_** `tweet embed`, the `tweet` takes a **_half_** a **_second_** to a **_full second_** to **load**. After that, it will **_always appear_** during the **_current_** `site visit`. **_However_**, on the `post` in which I have **_several_** `tweet embeds`, for **_all_** of **_them_** to **load**, it **_takes longer_** on **_first load_**. After that, they **_always appear_** for the **_current_** `site visit`. The **_same_** delayed process **_occurs_** with **_each_** `site visit` for **_multiple_** `tweet embeds` on **_one page_**.

No, it is **_not perfect_**. Yes, I **_will have_** to **mention** something
about it in my `FAQs` **page**. Will I be **_revisiting_** this? Yes. When
`tweet embeds`**_become_** more `predominant/important` on my `site`. But **_for now_**, this **approach** will **_have_** to **_do_**. And the `performance` of the **_single_** `tweet embed` in the **_recent post_** is **_quick enough_**. I am **_glad_**, however, that I did **_not_** have to **_give up_** `Giscus` for **_actual_** `Twitter` **_tweet embeds_** using
`platform.twitter.com/widgets.js`, **which have** such **_poor performance_**!

**Note**: It **_will_** be worth **_revisiting_** Maxime’s `code`, because his `tweets` are **_already rendered_** to the **page** when you **_land_** on it. There is **_no delay_** whatsoever. He really **_did do_** a **beautiful job** of **_creating_** `static tweets`.

`react-static-tweets` **_also provides_** an `SSR` (`server side rendering`)
**approach**, which **_might_** be worth **_testing out_**.
