***Photo by*** [David Dibert](https://www.pexels.com/@dibert/) ***on*** [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/photo/flock-of-penguins-near-sea-1299391/)

***Last week*** I ***received*** a ***new*** `macbook pro laptop` I ***had purchased***. My ***old laptop*** had seen ***better days***. I had **lost functionality*** in my `t` ***key*** on my `keyboard`. My `external speakers` were ***shot***. And ***after*** I had ***already purchased*** and ***received***
the `laptop`, I ***found out*** that my `thunderbolt port` was ***dying***.

***How*** did I ***find*** THAT ***piece*** of ***information*** out? I was ***trying*** to ***transfer*** my `data` from my old ***computer*** onto my ***new one*** with the `OSX Migration Assistant`, and ***nothing happened***.

I ***wanted*** to ***know*** if I had perhaps ***made*** a ***mistake***, so I took ***both laptops*** to the `Apple Store` at `Grand Central` to ***get*** the `migration` ***done there***.

A ***very nice*** `Apple Genius` ***representative*** set me up and ***started*** the `data migration` ***process*** using the `OSX Migration Assistant`. It ***started alright***, ***just as*** it ***had done*** at ***home***, but then it ***suddenly stopped***, ***as*** it ***had done*** at ***home***. ***At first*** we ***continued*** with the ***process*** thinking that it was ***just*** a ***matter*** of `data size`. But ***after*** a ***while***, we ***realized*** that ***no progress*** was ***being made***. The `Genius` ***rep*** ran a `diagnostic` on ***my computer*** and ***didn’t find*** anything TOO ***terrible***. My ***battery*** was ***running*** at `77%`. It was at the **_consuming level_**, so ***not yet*** in the `danger zone`. But ***definitely close***! He ***guessed*** that it ***had*** to have ***something*** to ***do*** with my `thunderbolt connection`. He ***didn’t know*** if it was ***my port*** that was ***faulty***, or the ***store’s***. He ***recommended*** that I ***visit*** the `iStore`, an ***approved*** `Apple Premier Support Provider`. They ***specialize*** in ***data recovery***, among other things. He said that ***they would*** be ***able*** to ***run*** a ***much deeper*** `diagnostic` of ***my computer***.

I ***went***. I ***dropped off***. I waited ***two days***. I ***returned*** and ***picked up***. Everything ***seemed*** just ***fine***. The ***only difference*** was that ***suddenly*** a `new user` had been ***created*** on my ***new laptop***. It was ***called*** `postgreSQL`. I ***didn’t think*** much of it, and ***used*** the ***same credentials*** I ***had*** when I ***installed*** `postgres` on my ***old computer***.

When I ***got home***, I ***started working*** on a ***project*** which had ***worked well*** previously. **_However_**, now I was ***not able*** to ***update*** `table records`. I only could ***create*** a `table`, add a `record` to a `table`, and ***delete*** a `record` from a `table`. I ***could not*** `edit` a `record`.

This **drove*** me ***crazy***. ***Was*** it my ***code***? ***Was*** it the ***fact*** that ***all*** my `postgres` **_related_** `directories` were ***located*** in a **_separate_** `OSX user` **_created_** from the `migration` **_initiated_** by the
`OSX Migration Assistant`? Or was it ***something else_**?

I ***went back*** to the `iStore`. I ***talked*** to ***them*** about the **_new_**
`postgreSQL user account` on my **laptop**. We ***looked*** into it ***together***. I had `permissions issues` on **_that account_** because it was ***separate***, and also
a ***standard account***. If I ***wanted*** to ***give*** it `administrative privileges`
**_permanently_**, I ***would have*** to **_either_** `downgrade` or `remove` my
**_current_** `administrative account` ***permanently***. THAT was NOT ***an option***.
***Besides***, my `goal` was to be `permanent owner` of my `postgres` ***install***. That could **_only_** be ***implemented*** if I ***installed*** it **_via_** `Homebrew`
in `Command Line`.

I don’t like ***deleting*** things as a ***rule***, but this was a ***necessary evil*** I ***knew*** I ***could not*** avoid. **_Of course_** I **created** a **_backup_** on my
***external*** `hard drive`.

The ***trip*** to the `iStore` to **_check out_** the `postgres user account` was
***earlier today***. When I ***got home***, I ***researched*** how to **_completely uninstall_** `postgres` on my `administrator account`, **_install it_** via
`Homebrew`, and ***subsequently*** get it **_running_**.

I **_uninstalled_**. I **_re-installed_** via **Homebrew**. I ***got*** it ***running*** AND my `code` ***working*** on the ***front*** AND ***backend***.

I am ***now*** the ***proud*** OWNER of my `postgreSQL` ***install***. This is what
***appeared*** in the `Command Line` ***after*** I ***installed*** `postgres` with
`Homebrew` via `Command Line`:

```js
mariacam=# CREATE DATABASE paymore;
CREATE DATABASE
mariacam=# \c paymore
You are now connected to database "paymore" as user "mariacam".
paymore=# select * from shoes;
paymore=# select * from shoes;
paymore=# select * from shoes;
paymore=# select * from shoes;
paymore=# select * from shoes;
paymore=# select * from shoes;
paymore=# select * from shoes;
paymore=# select * from shoes;
paymore=# select * from shoes;
paymore=# \dt+
                    List of relations
 Schema | Name  | Type  |  Owner   | Size  | Description
--------+-------+-------+----------+-------+-------------
 public | shoes | table | mariacam | 16 kB |
(1 row)

paymore=#
```

There were ***steps*** that I ***had*** to ***make*** before I ***got*** to ***this point***, but `postgres` now was **_installed directly_** into my `administrator account`. **_No question_** of ***ownership*** or **_permissions_**!

I came across ***several resources*** on the `web` that ***helped*** me ***get there***. You can ***find them*** below:
