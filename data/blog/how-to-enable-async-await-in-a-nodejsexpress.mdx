I was going through the **final project** for the **course** I am **teaching**
at **CityTech** called **Dynamic Web 1** which **includes** **_covering_**
`Modern Javascript` and **introduces** `Node.js`, `environment` **variables**,
`.dotenv`, `ESLint` **rules**, `APIs`, `API keys`, and **_how_** to **protect** them, the **creation** of `local` **scripts** in `package.json`, the `EJS` **templating engine** for `Express.js`, and `async/await`.

As I was **writing** the **documentation** for **building** the **application**, I **_noticed_** that there was an `ESLint` **error** **_regarding_** a couple of `arrow` **functions** I was **using**. I **_couldnâ€™t_** **understand** at **first** **_how_** that **could be** the **case**, but **_after_** **further investigation**, I **realized** it was **_not_** the `arrow` **function** that was **causing** the **error**, but **implementation** of `async/await` itself.

`async/await` was **introduced** to `JavaScript` in `ES2017`. **Since** I did
**_not_** **include** that in my `ESLint` **config**, the **use** of
`async/await` **using** `ESLint` **threw&& an **error\*\*.

I **_had_** to **add** the **_following_** **property** to the `"parserOptions"` **object** within in my `eslintrc.json` **file** in **order** to **make** that `error` **go away**:

```json
"parserOptions": {
    "ecmaVersion": 2017,
    "sourceType": "script"
},
```

And **_that_** was **it**!
