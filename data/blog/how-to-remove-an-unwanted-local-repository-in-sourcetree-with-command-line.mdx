So you may ask yourself _“What is the big deal about removing an unwanted
repository in [Sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) with
`Command Line`"_? **_I mean_**, **_like_**, _"I remove unwanted local
repositories all the time!”_ Well, the **_kind_** of **_unwanted_**
`local repository` I’m **_talking about_** is the **_kind_** that `incorporates`
**_all_** the **_files_** on `your computer`. _“But how is that possible?”_ you
**_may ask_**. I’ll **_tell you_**.

I am **_still_** fairly new to [Sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/), but
have become **_much more familiar_** with it as a **_result_** of a
`“brain fart”` I **_experienced_** last week. I **_forgot_** to `drag` the
`folder` I **_wanted_** to `track` into the
[Sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) `bookmarks window`. **_Instead_**,
I **_created_** a **_new_** `repository` **_directly_** in the
`bookmarks window`.

**_Take_** a **_look_** at the `image` of the
[Sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) `bookmarks window` **_located
above_**. **_There_**, you will **_see_** a `tab` **_called_**
`“New Repository”`. If you **_create_** a `repository` in **_that way_**, you
will **_also_** be **_creating_** a `local git` (or `mercurial`)
**_repository_** at the **_same time_**, AND it will **_by default_** `create` a
`path` **_from_** your `home directory`. **_And_** as we **_all know_**, that is
where **_all_** the `files` on our c`omputer` **_reside_**! I **_had_** a
`brain fart` and **_created_** my `repository` in this way **_instead_** of
**_dragging_** a `folder` **_from_** `one` of my `local installs` **_into_** the
`bookmarks window`. When you **_drag_** a `folder` **_into_** the
`bookmarks window`, [Sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) **_immediately
recognizes_** the `path` to **_that folder_**, which is **_really cool_**.
**_Not_** `so cool` when you **_inadvertently create_** the `repository`
**_within_** the `bookmarks window`.

So **_what_** is a **_girl_** to **_do_** when her `whole computer`
**_resides_** in a [Sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/)
**_repository_**? **_First_** of **_all_**, I **_did_** NOTHING **_with_**
`this repository`. **_Luckily_**, I **_immediately realized_** my `mistake`.
**_Luckily_**, I **_realized_** that I **_shouldn’t take_** `any kind` of
`action`. In **_other words_**, I **_shouldn’t_** `track anything`. I
**_shouldn’t_** `commit anything`. I **_should do_** NOTHING **_until_** I
**_learned how_** to **_get rid_** of it. That was the **_only thing_** to
**_do_** here. And I **_also knew_** that I **_had_** to **_exhibit_**
`extreme patience`. I **_knew_** that **_there was_** definitely a **_way out_**
of **_my dilemma_**. I **_just didn’t know_** `how` to **_get out_** of it
**_myself_**. I **_left_** a **_message_** on the
[Atlassian Forums](https://community.atlassian.com/) **_regarding_** my
**_dilemma_**, and I **_RSVPed_** to a
[Hacker Hours](https://www.meetup.com/hackerhours/) **_meetup_** (which I
attended yesterday) **_just_** in **_case_**.

I **_didn’t receive_** any `response` to **_my dilemma_** from
`Atlassian Support`. I **_received_** an `automated message` **_indicating
receipt_** of **_my email_**, but **_that_** was **_it_**. I **_received_** a
`response` **_from someone_** `in` the `Forums` **_with_** a **_possible
solution_**, but was **_not able_** to **_respond_** to **_his response_**! I
**_had made_** a `total combination` of **_3 questions/comments_** in the
**_Forums_**, so I **_wasn’t able_** to **_initiate_** any more **_activity_**
there **_until_** I **_accumulated_** `25 points`. `“How retarded is that?”` I
**_told myself_**. I **_had_** this **_major issue_** I **_had_** to
**_resolve_**, and there was **_no way_** for me to **_communicate_**
`with anyone` in the **_Forum_**! I **_prayed hard_** that `someone` would **_be
able_** to **_help me_** at `Hacker Hours`.

**_Lo_** and **_behold_**, I **_overheard_** a **_conversation_** about
`Command Line` going on **_behind me_** during
[Hacker Hours](https://www.meetup.com/hackerhours/), and I **_knew_** that I
**_was in_** the **_right place_**. `Jasmine`, the **_meetup lead_**,
**_showed_** me **_how_** to get **_rid of_** the **_local_** `.git` I had
**_inadvertently created_** with my `home directory` in
[Sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) **_using_** `Command Line`:

```shell
rm -rf .git
```

**_Basically_**, **_this_** `command` gets **_rid of_** the **_local_** `.git`
**_folder_** that’s **_created_** when you **_create local_** `.git`
**_repositories_**. When you get **_rid of_** this **_folder_**,
[Sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) will **_no longer_** `recognize`
the `repository` **_associated_** with **_that folder_**. The `downside` is that
**_if_** you **_have other_** `local repositories` that you **_have created_**
in the **_same location_**, you will **_lose them_** as well. What **_made it_**
so **_easy_** for **_me_** to get **_rid of_** my **_local_** `.git`
**_repository_** was that I **_hadn’t tracked_** any `files`, and I **_hadn’t
committed_** `anything`. **_In addition_**, I **_hadn’t_** created **_any
other_** local `.git` **_repositories_** on `my computer`. **_Only_**
`this one`. **_All_** my **_other repositories_** were **_created_** via `drag`
and `drop`, and therefore were **_not local_** `.git` **_repositories_**. They
were **_just_** `local repositories` that I **_hadn’t connected_** to **_any_**
`remote repositories` **_either_**.

I **_took away_** a **_couple_** of **_very_** `important things` from this
**_experience_**:

-   `Be patient`. **_Being impatient_** or **_impulsive_** will **_only lead_**
    to `disaster`. If you **_aren’t sure_** about **_how_** to **_rectify_** a
    **_situation_**, `wait` **_until_** you **_come across_** the `sure fire`
    **_solution_**. **_Better yet_**, `wait` **_until_** you **_come across_**
    an **_opportunity_** to **_resolve_** your **_issue_** `face-to-face` with
    **_people_** who **_know_** what they **_are doing_**.

-   If you are `lucky enough` to **_immediately recognize_** that you’ve
    **_made_** a **_mistake_**, DON’T DO ANYTHING. Just **_let_** the
    `repository` **_sit there_** until you have the **_appropriate knowledge_**
    to **_remove_** it. **_Don’t_** be **_tempted_** to `track anything` **_just
    because_**. **_Don’t_** be **_tempted_** to `commit anything` **_just
    because_**. Just **_forget about_** it, **_just because_**!
