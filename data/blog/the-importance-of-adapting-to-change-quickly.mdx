**Note Tuesday, February 7, 2023**: The `Trump Talks Trash` **_app_** has been
**_refactored_** since this `post` **_was written_**. I have **_included_**
`links` to **_both_** the `live application` and the `Github repository` at the
**_end_** of this `post`.

**_Lately_**, I had **_been focusing_** more on the `backend` of
`web development`. **_Recently_**, I **_started revisiting_** some of the
`front end` **_projects_** I had **_created_** some **_time ago_**. Some
**_were_** even from **_more than_** `two years` **_ago_**! **_One_**
`static app` in **_particular_**, **_no longer_** even **_worked locally_** or
**_remotely_** (for **_different reasons_**).

**_Looking on it_**, I **_found_** that `Front End` **_development_** can be
**_extremely_** `workflow` **_heavy_**. **_In fact_**, it **_usually_** is, if
there is **_anything_** of **_any import_** going on. But with **_knowledge_**
of the **_big picture_**, one can **_pare down_** the `workflow`
**_drastically_** if it is a **_simple_** `application`.

**_More_** than **_two years_** ago, I **_had created_** a `static app` called
`Random Quote Machine`. I **_used_** `webpack`, **_many_** `npm packages`,
`ES6 modules`, **jQuery**, **JavaScript**, **Gulp**, etc. It was just a single
page app! Yes, I **_had developed_** a **_great_** `front end workflow` which I
**_re-used_** in **_many_** of my `static apps`, so that **_made_** `set up`
**_fairly quick_**. BUT it **_had taken_** a **_long time_** to **_fine tune_**
it! I had **_much more_** `code` **_dedicated_** to the `workflow` **_than_** I
**_did_** to the `app code` **_itself_**.

**_When_** I **_revisited_** my `Random Quote Machine` to **_update_** it, I
**_found_** that it **_would involve_** a **_complete revam_**p. **_First_** of
**_all_**, a **_number_** of the `packages` I had **_been using_** now
**_revealed_** `vulnerabilities`. **_How_** do I **_know_** that? Because **_as
of_** `npm@6`, a **_new feature_** called `npm security audits` **_began_**.
**_Fixing_** these `vulnerabilities` if they are **_not_** immediately
**_fixable_** **_with_** the `npm audit fix` **command** can be **_fairly
complicated_**. And **_many packages_** are **_not regularly_** `maintained` in
the **_long run_**. A `package` can be the **_hottest thing_** around **_one
day_**, and **_abandoned_** or **_lost_** its **_popularity_** to the **_next_**
`hottest thing` the **_next day_**.

I **_really wanted_** to **_create_** a **_new_** `random quote api` **_app_**
that was

1. **_Free to use_**

2. Had **_no api keys_**. I finally came up with one! Not surprisingly, it was a
   `quotes api` consisting of **_Trump_** **quotes** called
   `What Does Trump Think?` For me it was not so much about getting the right
   kind of quotes, just that it was **_free_** and **did not require**
   `api keys`!

I **_also_** didn’t want to **_fiddle_** with **_updating_** a **_new_**
`front end workflow` for **_this particular_** `project`. I **_ended_** up
**_creating_** a [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) `app` **_using_** the
[ejs](https://ejs.co/) (`embedded javascript`) **_view engine_** for
[Express](https://expressjs.com/), a `minimalist framework for Nodejs`. I was
**_only using_** **_one_** `image` which was **_not large_**, and there were
**_no fancy_** `animations` **_involved_**.

I **_reduced_** my `code` **_drastically_**. I **_updated_** the `method` I
**_used_** to **_call_** the `API`. I **_used_** the
[fetch() API method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch)
**_instead_** of
[AJAX](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/AJAX). This **_also
meant_** that I could **_use_** `pure`
[JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
**_instead_** of **_mixing_** with [jQuery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery) as
well.

I **_must admit_** that this was **_just_** a `quick fix` for **_something_**
that really **_did not need_** more **_complexity_** and that I **_have_** to
**_continue investigating_** what my **_new_** `front end workflow` **_should
be_**. It **_still_** is a **_good example_** of **_adapting quickly_** to
`change` when it **_comes to_** (`web`) `development`. One has to
**_constantly_** be on **_one’s toes_**. I’m **_telling you_**, that is **_very
hard_** to **_do_**!
