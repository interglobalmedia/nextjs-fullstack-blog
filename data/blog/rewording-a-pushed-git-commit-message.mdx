**Sometimes** we **are** in a **rush** and we **push** our `commits` to `remote` with **messages** that **_might_** **contain** `typos`, or we **find** **_later on_** that we **could have** simply **made** a **_better_** `commit message`.

If you **find** that you **made** a `typo` in a **_pushed_** `commit message` or **wanted** to `amend` the `message` in **some way**, you **can do** the
**_following_**:

```shell
git rebase -i HEAD~n
```

which **displays** the `git rebase -i HEAD~n` **last** `n` **commits** of the
**_current_** **branch** you are in. So if you are **_not_** actually in the
**branch** which **contains** the `commit message` you want to **change**, you
**have** to `checkout` into that **branch** **_first_** with the **command**
`git checkout branchname`. In my recent case, for instance, it was the `master` branch, so the command would be `git checkout master`.

Be **sure**, **however**, to **_first_** **commit** all **changes** you have
**made** in **_that_** **branch** **_before_** **checking out** into the
**_other_** **branch**.

**Once** you have **checked out** into the **branch** in **question**, `run`

```shell
git rebase -i HEAD~n
```

and it will `return` **something** **_like_** the **following**:

```shell
pick e499d89 Delete CNAME
pick 0c39034 Better README
pick f7fde4a Change the commit message but push the same commit.
# Rebase 9fdb3bd..f7fde4a onto 9fdb3bd
#
# Commands:
# p, pick = use commit
# r, reword = use commit, but edit the commit message
# e, edit = use commit, but stop for amending
# s, squash = use commit, but meld into previous commit
# f, fixup = like "squash", but discard this commit's log message
# x, exec = run command (the rest of the line) using shell
#
# These lines can be re-ordered; they are executed from top to bottom.
#
# If you remove a line here THAT COMMIT WILL BE LOST.
#
# However, if you remove everything, the rebase will be aborted.
#
# Note that empty commits are commented out
```

**First** **_press_** the `i` **key** so that you **go** into `insert` **mode**.

**Replace** `pick` with `reword` **_before_** each `commit message` you **want** to **change**. **Something** like **this**:

```shell
pick e499d89 Delete CNAME
reword 0c39034 Better README
reword f7fde4a Change the commit message but push the same commit.
```

**Save** and **close** the `commit` **file**. **Then** you will be **taken** to a **screen** that **looks** something **_like_** **this**:

```shell
reword 06ea4e4 dd new dist build

"~/Development/comd3663/javascript-teaching-folders/monsters-api/.git/COMMIT_EDI
TMSG" 18L, 591C
Press ENTER or type command to continue
```

**When** you **press** `enter`, the `Terminal` **window** will **look**
something like **this**:

```shell
reword 06ea4e4 dd new dist build

dd new dist build

# Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting
# with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit.
#
# Date:      Thu May 7 11:02:21 2020 -0400
#
# interactive rebase in progress; onto bac4a55
# Last command done (1 command done):
#    reword 06ea4e4 dd new dist build
# Next commands to do (4 remaining commands):
#    pick 0545c78 Add load event
#    pick fe1dada Add new dist build
# You are currently editing a commit while rebasing branch 'master' on 'bac4a55'.
#
# Changes to be committed:
#       modified:   dist/scripts/js/main.js
#
~
~
~

```

**Press** the `i` **key** **_again_** to **go** into `insert` **mode**, **make** the **change** you **want** to the `message`, and then **press** the `esc` **key** **_again_** **followed by** `:x` and then **finally** **_press_** the `return` **key** to be **taken back** to the `Terminal` **window**.

**Finally**, **run** the `command`

```shell
git push --force
```

to **force-push** the **_amended_** `commits`.

And if you **_don't_** **quite remember** the **_first_** `command` to **redo** these **steps** to `reword` **_another_** **pushed** `commit message` you **want** to **change**, you **can run** the

```shell
history
```

**command** in `Terminal`, and it will **show** **_all_** the **commands** you
**ran** in **_that_** **instance** of the `Terminal` **window**.

**However**, **_this_** **way** is **not optimal** if you are **working** with a **team**. It **means** that they **have** to update the **changes** in the `Git history` as a **result** of `git rebase` . This **approach** **_changes_** the **commits** `included` within the `n` **range** as well.

It is **_far_** **better** to **do** the **following**:

```shell
git log --oneline --graph
```

This **returns** something like **this** in `Terminal` :

```shell

bc47b1a (HEAD -> master, origin/master) Add new dist build
4ead7af Add inputsArray variable
fe11843 Add new dist build
c68f507 Add else ifs for validationMessage
e0ce9f7 Add new dist build
27574b1 change back to e.keyCode or e.which
d6480e1 Add new dist build
afea001 Replace e.keyCode e.which with e.key
612e5e5 Add new dist build
aad8dfa Spread inputs
12b86f1 Add new dist build
426d02a Add inputs forEach method event listeners
2b12b23 Remove reset button
28c32ae Add new dist build
3cdd794 Add background to :invalid pseudo class
101b53b Update npm
4012090 Add new dist build
0f79414 Change 8 to 7 in username message
31cd171 Add new main.js dist build
165f03e Conditionally change color of heading1 with js
d7dc13d Add new dist build
5c6000a Change quotes to ticks
56bf7c7 Add form attribute to submit button
579fccb Add new index.html dist build

```

**Next**, **choose** the **commit** `SHAH` you **want** to **change** the
**message** of and `run` the **following command** in `Terminal` :

```shell
git rebase -i 27574b1
```

for **example**. The **difference** between **_this_** approach and the
**previous** one is that you are **only changing** the `history` of **_that
one_** **commit** which **results**in a **new commit** `SHAH` . At **least** you are **_not_** **changing** a **whole bunch** of **others** as **_well_**.

**After** you have **made** your **changes** and **committed** them (same way as before), you can **check** and **make sure** everything **went** as
**expected**, **targeting** **_only_** that **one commit** by `re-reunning`

```shell
git log --oneline --graph
```

You **_should_** **see** that **only** the **commit** in **question's**
`commit SHAH` was **changed**.

The **_best_** when **dealing** with **teams** is to **try** and **get** it
**right** the **_first_** **time**! If you **work alone**, or people **enter**
the **picture** **_after_** these **changes** have **been made**, that's
**another story** **_altogether_**.
