This series is based on a series entitled
[A Complete Beginner's Guide to Django](https://simpleisbetterthancomplex.com/series/beginners-guide/1.11/)
by Vitor Freitas on his site
[simpleisbetterthancomplex.com/](https://simpleisbetterthancomplex.com/) from
over 7 years ago. I have made updates to outdated code/content, added features,
and am making some changes and additions to the structure, functionality, and
design. It is thanks to him that I learned a lot I did not learn anywhere else
about Django! Check it out to compare what he did in his series and development
sequence compared to mine. I hope you will enjoy building this project, I know I
have!

You can also check out the `GitHub` repository for
[django-boards](https://github.com/interglobalmedia/django-boards/blob/main/django_boards/templates/base.html).
Each section is associated with a different branch, so you can go back in
history on GitHub to follow the development of this project from the beginning.
The `link` to the `repository` is `included` under `Related Resources` in _each
section_ of this `series`. It is also `available` under `Related Resources`
here.

If you `have` any `questions`, you can also `reach out` to `me` in `Giscus`
comments at the `end` of `any` _given_ `posts`. Simply `click` on
`"Load comments"` at the `bottom` of a `post`. `I` _will_ `be` _initiating_
`discussions` _so_ `that` you `can` _do_ `so`.` Please note` that you `do` _have
to_ `have` an `account` on `Github` _to be_ `able` _to post_ `comments`.

    accounts resides.
1.  [How to create a fullstack application using Django and Python Part 16](/blog/how-to-create-a-fullstack-application-using-django-and-python-part-16):
    In this section, I demonstrate an alternative to the original
    test_form_inputs test in which we used the .assertContains() method to
    verify the existence of specific inputs residing in the signup form. I
    install Beautiful Soup 4 and Soup Sieve along with the html5lib HTML parser,
    and then re-create the test_form_inputs test using those packages. The test
    is much shorter, and my approach to discovering the ids of the inputs I want
    to grab by inspecting the signup form element in the browser is quicker and
    much easier to read!
1.  [How to create a fullstack application using Django and Python Part 17](/blog/how-to-create-a-fullstack-application-using-django-and-python-part-17):
    In this section, I improve signup.html template design, add a logout view
    and route, create a dropdown menu for logged in users, create a login.html
    template, url, and redirect, create a reusable template, add non-field
    errors to login.html, create custom template tags to use in form.html, and
    test the template tags.

    In this section, I create the password_reset routes, views, tests, and
    templates. The results of the password reset process are output to the
    Terminal console. I debug the password_reset_confirm_tests tests to find out
    what the actual csrf token is and hard code it into the test_csrf (function)
    test. I re-use the Beautiful Soup 4 and Soup Sieve packages to refactor the
    test_form_inputs (function) test.
1.  [How to create a fullstack application using Django and Python Part 19](/blog/how-to-create-a-fullstack-application-using-django-and-python-part-19#related-posts):

    redirect, I create @login_required tests, I update the topic posts view,
    create the topic_posts.html template and related tests, update the reply
    post (reply_topic) view and create related tests, discuss QuerySets and use
    them to improve the index/home view, improve the topics view, update the
    board_topics view, update the topics.html template, and add a new field to
    the Topic model.
1.  [How to create a fullstack application using Django and Python Part 20](/blog/how-to-create-a-fullstack-application-using-django-and-python-part-20):
    In this section, I re-organize the accounts and boards tests content,
    refactor password reset-related django_boards/urls.py, fix the password
    reset-related accounts tests failures, add the password_change URL to
    templates/base.html, fix the 302 redirect-related failure in the
    boards.tests.test_view_reply_topic_tests, and add the reply_topic URL to
    templates/topic_posts.html.

    In this section, I create a generic class-based (GCBV) PostUpdateView,
    PostDeleteView, and PostDetailView, create the associated urls and
    templates, create PostUpdateView, PostDeleteView, and PostDetailView tests,
    debug the code and tests, and check the test coverage of the django_boards
    project code.
1.  [How to create a fullstack application using Django and Python Part 22](/blog/how-to-create-a-fullstack-application-using-django-and-python-part-22):
    In this section, I experiment with the Python shell to demonstrate how
    pagination works under the hood, I implement a Generic Class Based view and
    pagination to the index/home view, add Class Based View pagination to the
    topics view and topic_posts view, add Bootstrap 5 pagination to the
    associated templates, refactor the associated urls in urls.py, and refactor
    the associated tests. I also add a copy link button to copy the link to a
    topic's replies (posts), a scroll top and scroll bottom button using
    JavaScript to enable their functionality, and add JavaScript code to make
    the scrollbar return to the bottom of the page when a pagination item (page
    number) is clicked.
1.  [How to create a fullstack application using Django and Python Part 23](/blog/how-to-create-a-fullstack-application-using-django-and-python-part-23):
    In this section, I create a generic class based view called UserUpdateView
    (My Account view), associated tests, a URL, and template.
1.  [How to create a fullstack application using Django and Python Part 24](/blog/how-to-create-a-fullstack-application-using-django-and-python-part-24):
    In this section, I add markdown functionality to the Post model, the
    reply_topic.html and topic_posts.html templates, and I implement ES6 modules
    to our JavaScript code. This means refactoring the copy (link) button and
    associated html markup and CSS. I refactored and modularize the scroll top
    and bottom button JavaScript code and associated CSS, modularize the
    pagination behavior JavaScript code, import the ES6 modules into a new file
    called app.js, and add the type="module" attribute to the app.js script tag
    in templates/base.html.
1.  [How to create a fullstack application using Django and Python Part 25](/blog/how-to-create-a-fullstack-application-using-django-and-python-part-25):

    containing extra fields, create the Profile model in accounts/models.py,
    extend the User model using a one-to-one relationship with the built-in
    User, add a profile url to accounts.urls.py, moved the account url in
    boards/urls.py to accounts/urls.py, install the pillow package to enable use
    of the ImageField in the Profile model, configure urls.py for user-uploaded
    media files during development, implement signals.py in the accounts app,
    create an update profile form, create a profile.html template, delete
    existing users pre User profile and create new ones, and make styling
    adjustments to various templates.

    implement better control over the view count in templates/index.html, limit
    replies to the last 10 posts on templates/reply_topic.html, redirect the
    user to the last topic posts page instead of the first, update
