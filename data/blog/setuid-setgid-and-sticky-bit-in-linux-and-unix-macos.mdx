In `previous articles` I **_discussed_** `changing file` and
`directory permissions`. `In` this `article`, I `discuss elevating`
**_current_** `user privileges` **_without_** the `use` of `sudo`, and
`restricting privileges` to `root` or `current user` regarding `modifying` or
`deleting files` at the `directory level`.

## setuid and sudo

The `setuid` (aka `suid`) file `permission` **_permits_** a `user` to `execute`
a `file` or `program` with the `permission` of the `owner` of that `file`
or` program`. In other words, `setuid` allows a `user` to `run` a `program` as
the `owner` of the `program file` rather than as `themselves`.

`One` **_of_** the most **_popular_** `setuid` permissions is `sudo`. if I run
`which sudo` in `Terminal`, it `returns` the `following`:

```shell
/usr/bin/sudo
```

The `which` command `locates` the `paths` of `executable files` such as `sudo`.

If I run `ls -l /usr/bin/sudo`, it returns:

```shell
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 232416  Apr 3 2023 /usr/bin/sudo
```

The `sudo` executable contains an `"s"` in its permissions instead of an `x`
(`execute permission`). The `"s"` **_represents_** the `setuid` file permission.
The `rest` of the `world` (`groups` and `other`) has `execute` (`x`) permissions
for `sudo`. This means that `when` a `user` **_executes_** `sudo`, the `OS` will
`not execute` the `file` as the `standard user` but as `root`. Therefore, `sudo`
**_permits a_** `standard user` **_to perform_** `elevated system functions`
**_without having_** to `log in` as the `root user`.

It is `important` to `note`, **_however_**, **_that only_** `standard users`
with `access` to `sudo` **_can change_** `ownership` of `files` and
`directories`. `Any user` that a `standard user` with `sudo privileges`
**_creates_** on the `system` **_does not_** `have access` to `sudo` by
`default`. At least `this is` the `case` in the `Linux distribution` **_I am_**
`using`: `Linux Mint`.

## How to set up setuid using chmod

Let's `revisit` the `chown-directory` I `created` in my article entitled
[The chown command in Linux and Unix (macOS)](/blog/the-chown-command-in-linux-and-unix-macos)
and its `contents`. I `transferred ownership` from `user maria` to
`user magdala` for `both` the `parent directory` `chown-directory` and `all` its
`files` and `subdirectory`. `In order` to `be able` to `modify` a `file`, let's
say `chown-file1.txt` **_without_** `root` privileges, I could `run` the
`following` in `Terminal` using `chmod` in `symbolic mode`:

```shell
sudo chmod u+s chown-file1.txt
```

Here I am changing `file permissions` in `symbolic mode`. I can use `chmod` with
`numeric notation` as well.

And then to `check` the `result` of `running` the `above`, I run
`ls -l inside `chown-directory`, and the `following`is`returned`:

```shell
total 4
-rwSrw-r-- 1 magdala magdala    0 Jul 20 23:19 chown-file1.txt
-rw-rw-r-- 1 magdala magdala    0 Jul 20 23:19 chown-file2.txt
srwxrwxr-x 2 magdala magdala 4096 Jul 20 23:19 chown-subdirectory
```

`There` is `something` a `bit off` here with the `S` that `resulted` from
`execution` of `sudo chmod u+s chown-file1.txt` setting `setuid` on
`chown-file1.txt`. It is `uppercase` instead of `lowercase`. This `means` that a
`standard user` does `not` have `execute permission` to **_modify_** or
**_delete_** `chown-file1.txt`. If I try and `modify` the `file` in `Vim`, and
then `save changes` made to it, I get the `following message` in `Vim`:

```shell
E45: 'readonly' option is set (add ! to override)
```

When I add `!` right after `:x` (`:x!`), I still `cannot save` the `changes` I
`made` to the `file`. To get out of `Vim` I have to type `:q!`, which `quits` me
`out` of `Vim`, and `modifications` are `not saved`.

In order to be able to execute `chown-file1.txt`, I have to `add` execute
`permissions` using `chmod`:

```shell
sudo chown -v u+x chown-file1.txt
```

which `results` in the `following` as `stdout` in `Terminal`:

```shell
[sudo] password for maria:
mode of 'chown-file1.txt' changed from 4664 (rwSrw-r--) to 4764 (rwsrw-r--)
```

Now the `s` representing `setuid` is `lowercase`, just as with `setuid`
permission for `sudo`. This means that now `standard user maria` has
`execute permissions` for `chown-file1.txt`, owned by `standard user magdala`.

**_Technically_**, **_however_**, `contrary` to `what` is `often shown` in
`examples elsewhere`, `setuid` would **_not_** work on a regular `.txt` file. It
`only works` on `executables`, `indicating` that when `running` the
`executable`, `setuid` will `set` its (`execute`) `permission` to that of the
`user` (`owner`) who `created it` and `not` the `user` who `executed it`. This
would be the `root user` instead of the `standard user` executing it.

```shell
rm: remove write-protected regular file 'chown-file1.txt'? y # I typed y for yes
rm: cannot remove 'chown-file1.txt': Permission denied
```

Now if I **_try_** and **_actually modify_** `chown-file1.txt`, I still can't.
The `above examples` are for `demonstration only`. `Being able` to `modify` or
`delete` **_another_** `user`'s file `would create` **_a grave_**
`security vulnerability` to `say` the `least`. In my `Linux Mint` distribution,
I can `find out` which `commands` have `setuid` set to them. This then would
`indicate` whether `standard user`(s) I `create` with my `standard user account`
with `access` to `sudo` have `access` to `those commands` (`executables`).

For example, if I run `which su` (switch user), which returns:

```shell
/usr/bin/su
```

And then run `ls -l /usr/bin/su` to `find out` what its `permissions` are, the
`following` is `returned`:

```shell
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 55672 Feb 29 2022 /usr/bin/su
```

There is a lowercase `s` representing `setuid` instead of an `x` representing
`execute permission`. This `means` that `user magdala` **_without access_** to
has `elevated access` to the `su` command.

If I run `which ls` which returns:

```shell
/usr/bin/ls
```

And then run `ls -l /usr/bin/ls` to `find out` what its `permissions` are, the
`following` is `returned`:

```shell
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 138208 Feb 7 2022 /usr/bin/ls
```

Here, `setuid` is `not set` to the `ls` command. **_Therefore_**, `user magdala`
**_cannot use_** this `command` on `files` or `directories` that are `owned` by
`other users`.

If I run `which cat` which returns:

```shell
/usr/bin/cat
```

And then run `ls -l /usr/bin/cat` to `find out` what its `permissions` are, the
`following` is `returned`:

```shell
-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root 35280 Feb 7 2022 /usr/bin/cat
```

And so on. So if you are logged in as a user with limited access (cannot access
`sudo`) and don't have access to an executable because of a file's or
directories ownership or permissions, you can take the following steps to find
out what permissions have been set to that executable.

`Another` **_popular_** `executable` is `passwd`. The following are its
permissions:

```shell
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 59976 Nov 24 2022 /usr/bin/passwd
```

This is a good thing. This `means` that `standard users` **_cannot modify_** or
**_delete_** `regular files` or `directories` of other `standard users`. That's
why it is important to **_limit_** `user access` to `sudo` on a `local network`
where there are a number of actual `standard users`, **_because otherwise_**
`anyone` would `be able` to `tinker` with `anyone else`'s `files` on the
`system`! In essence, the `setuid` bit has `no effect` on `non-executable` files
of `standard users`, like `.txt`, for example.

Now let's use an executable file as an example. Let's say I create an executable
called `hello.sh`. It contains the following content:

```shell
#!/bin/bash
hello_world="Hello world!"

echo $hello_world
```

## setuid a shell script

Even though I may `set` the `setuid` for a `shell script` **_owned by_**
`another user`, i.e., `hello.sh`:

```shell
-rwsrw-r-- magdala magdala 118 Jul 22 06:40 hello.sh
```

I cannot execute this script, even though I have set `hello.sh` to user execute
permissions for `setuid` as indicated by the lowercase `"s"`.

```shell
bash: ./hello.sh: Permission denied
```

I can't however, execute `hello_world.sh` using `sudo`:

```shell
sudo ./hello_world.sh
# which returns:
[sudo] password for maria:
sudo: unable to execute ./hello_world.sh: No such file or directory
```

I **_can execute_** `hello.sh` **_without using_** `sudo` by `running` the
`following` in `Terminal`:

```shell
bash ./hello.sh
```

I am able to `"execute"` `hello.sh` (have it `"interpreted"` by the
`bash "interpreter"`) because I am passing `hello.sh` explicitly to the
`interpreter` (`bash`). "Having hello.sh interpreted" is just **_another way_**
of **_stating_** `"executed"`.

## setuid a directory

`setuid has no effect on directories.

## setgid and crontab

`setgid` (aka `sgid`) is similar to `setuid`. When a `process` is `executed`, it
will `run` as the `group` that `owns` the `file`. An `example` of a `file`
**_that uses_** `setgid` is `crontab`. I can `get` the `path` to `crontab` by
`running` the `following command` in `Terminal`:

```shell
which crontab
```

which `returns` the `following`:

```shell
/usr/bin/crontab
```

And if I run `ls -l /usr/bin/crontab` in `Terminal`, the `following` is
`returned`:

```shell
-rwxr-sr-x 1 root crontab 39568 Mar 23 2022 /usr/bin/crontab
```

Just as `setuid` is set to the `sudo` command by default, `setgid` is set to the
`crontab` command by default as well. `crontab` (aka `CRON TABLE`) is a `file`
which `contains` a `schedule` of `cron entries` that are `scheduled` to `run` at
`specified times`. `cron` is a `Linux`, `Unix`, or `solaris utility` that allows
`tasks` to be `automatically run` in the `background` at `regular intervals` by
the `cron daemon`. `setgid` is set to `crontab` for security reasons. This is a
popular use case for `setgid`.

Group `crontab` has a very `special purpose`, and the `crontab binary` is
`owned` by the `crontab` group and has a `setgid` bit as `indicated` in the
`file permissions` above.

`cron` and `crontab` are `beyond` the `scope` of this `article`, but I will
`discuss` it in a `future article`.

## How to set up setgid using chmod

In order to setup `setgid`, again we `use` the `chmod` command. This is
`similar` to setting up `setuid`. For example:

```shell
# first I set setgid to the setgid-file.txt
chmod g+s setgid-file.txt
# Next I run `ls -l setgid-file.txt to check permissions
ls -l setgid-file.txt
## which returns:
-rw-rwSr-- 1 maria maria 0 Jul 15:07 setgid-file.txt
```

Since an **_uppercase_** `S` is `returned`, I know that `setgid-file.txt` does
not have execute permissions, which is necessary. So next, I run the following:

```shell
# First I set execute permissions on setgid for setgid-file.txt
chmod g+x setgid-file.txt
# Next I run `ls -l setgid-file.txt to check permissions
ls -l setgid-file.txt
# which returns:
-rw-rwsr-- 1 maria maria 0 Jul 22 15:07 setgid-file.txt
```

## So why setuid or setgid?

An `administrator` might want to use `setuid` or `setgid` if they want
**_certain_** `users` or `groups` to `be able` to perform `specific tasks` that
require `root` or `superuser privileges`, but `don't want` to actually `provide`
them with `access` to `sudo`. This is `analogous` to the
[principle of least privilege](https://www.cyberark.com/what-is/least-privilege/),
where a `user` is given `minimum levels` of `access` or `permissions` needed to
`perform` his/her `job`. It is `important` to `note` (`again`) that this
`relates` to `executable` files (`executables`).

**_Again_**, the `setgid` example above is for `demonstration purposes` only.
`Executables` are `set` to `setuid` and `setgid` **_by default_** in the
`Linux OS`, `in` **_my_** `case`, `Linux Mint`.

## setgid and directories

Setting `setgid` on a `directory` **_results in_** `different behavior` **_than
with_** `files`. When `setgid` is `set` to a `directory`, it `causes` all
`files` that are `created` in that `directory` to be `owned` by the `group` of
the `directory` and `not` the `owner` of the `group`.

`Let's say` I `create` a `directory` called `setgid-directory`, and then I
`change` the `group` of the `directory` using the `chgrp` command:

```shell
sudo chgrp magdala setgid-directory
```

which `returns` the `following` when I run `ls -ld setgid-directory`:

```shell
drwxrwxr-x  2 maria magdala 4096  Jul 22 16:54 setgid-directory
```

Then I set `setgid` to `setgid-directory`:

```shell
chmod g+s setgid-directory/
```

which `returns` the `following` in `Terminal` when I run
`ls -ld getgid-directory/`:

```shell
drwxrwsr-x  2 maria magdala 4096  Jul 22 16:54 setgid-directory
```

**_Next_**, to `test` this `out`, I `create` a `file` **_inside the_**
`setgid-directory` directory:

```shell
# create new file inside setgid-directory called setgid-file1.txt
touch setgid-directory/setgid-file1.txt
# check the group ownership of setgid-file1.txt
ls -l setgid-directory
# which returns the following:
-rw-rw-r-- 1 maria magdala 0 Jul 22 16:54 setgid-file1.txt
```

The `file` I `create` inside `setgid-directory` **_inherits_** the `group` that
`setgid-directory` belongs to.

## So what is sticky bit?

The **_special permission_** `sticky bit` makes sure that `only` the `owner` of
a `file`(s) `inside` a `directory` can `delete` or modify that `file`. A
`typical use` of this is the `/tmp/` directory. The `/tmp/` directory can be
written (`w`) by `any user`, but `other users` **_can't delete_** `other users'`
files.

If I run `ls -ld /tmp`, the `following` is `returned` in `Terminal`:

```shell
drwxrwxrwt  16 root root 4096 Jul 22 16:35 /tmp
```

One can tell when `sticky bit` has been `set` on a `directory` when there is a
`t` at the `end` of the `permissions`, `as above`.

Now let's test this out.

First I `create` a new `directory` called `stickybit-directory`.

Then I `run` the following `command` in `Terminal`:

```shell
chmod +t stickybit-directory
```

**_Next_**, I run `ls -ld stickybit-directory` and the `following` is
`returned`:

```shell
drwxrwxr-t maria maria 4096 Jul 22 19:33 stickybit-directory
```

Then I `create` a `file` inside `stickybit-directory` called
`stickybit-file1.txt`.

Then I `switch out` of `maria user` with the `su magdala` command (`su` stands
for `switch user`) and try to **_delete_** `owner maria`'s
`stickybit-directory/stickybit-file1.txt`:

```shell
su magdala
Password:
# maria user switches into magdala user
magdala@maria-VirtualBox:/home/maria/Desktop$
# delete maria user's stickybit-directory/stickybit-file1.txt as magdala user
rm stickybit-directory/stickybit-file1.txt
# which returns:
rm: remove write-protected regular empty file 'stickybit-directory/stickybit-file1.txt'? y # I type the "y" for "yes"
# which returns:
rm: cannot remove 'stickybit-directory/stickybit-file1.txt': Permission denied
```

## Setting special permissions (setuid, setgid, and sticky bit) in numeric mode

Not only can we set `special permissions` in
[symbolic mode](/blog/changing-permissions-using-symbolic-mode-and-numeric-mode-in-linux-and-unix-macos),
but we can also set them in
[numeric mode](/blog/changing-permissions-using-symbolic-mode-and-numeric-mode-in-linux-and-unix-macos).

`Let's say` I `create` a `file` called `setuid-numeric-mode-file.txt` and then
`set` file `permissions` using `chmod`:

```shell
chmod 764 setuid-numeric-mode-file.txt
```

And running `ls -l setuid-numeric-mode-file.txt` **_returns the_** `following`
in `Terminal`:

```shell
-rwxrw-r--  1 maria maria 0 Jul 22 20:33 setuid-numeric-mode-file.txt
```

`7` is `represented` by `rwx`, `6` is `represented` by `rw-`, and `4` is
`represented` by `r--`. To set `setuid` to `setuid-numeric-mode-file.txt`, I run
the `following` in `Terminal`:

```shell
chmod 4764 setuid-numeric-mode-file.txt
```

`4` represents `setuid` in `numeric mode`.

Now `let's say` I `create` a `file` called `setgid-numeric-mode-file.txt` and
then `set` file `permissions` using `chmod`:

```shell
chmod 2764 setgid-numeric-mode-file.txt
```

And running `ls -l setgid-numeric-mode-file.txt` **_returns the_** `following`
in `Terminal`:

```shell
-rwxrwSr--  1 maria maria 0 Jul 22 20:44 setgid-numeric-mode-file.txt
```

And `since` the `S` is `uppercase`, `I know` that the `file` does `not` have
`execute permissions`, so I also `have` to `run` the `following` to `make` that
`happen`:

```shell
chmod g+x setgid-numeric-mode-file.txt
```

Then I run `ls -l setgid-numeric-mode-file.txt` again and the `following` is
`returned` in `Terminal`:

```shell
-rwxrwsr--  1 maria maria 0 Jul 22 20:44 setgid-numeric-mode-file.txt
```

Now let's say I `create` a `file` called `stickybit-numeric-mode-file.txt` and
then `set permissions` using `chmod`:

```shell
chmod 1764 stickybit-numeric-mode-directory
```

And when I run `ls -ld stickybit-numeric-mode-directory` in `Terminal`, the
`following` is `returned`:

```shell
-rwxrw-r-T maria maria 0 Jul 22 20:54 stickybit-numeric-mode-directory
```

I `know `that `stickybit` does `not` have `execute permissions` because the `T`
that `represents` it is `uppercase`. So I `run` the `following command` in
`Terminal` to `fix that`:

```shell
chmod +x stickybit-numeric-mode-directory
```

This time when I run `ls -ld stickybit-numeric-mode-directory` the `following`
is `returned` in `Terminal`:

```shell
drwxrwxr-t  2 maria maria 4096 Jul 22 21:01 stickybit-numeric-mode-directory
```

## Removing special permissions (setuid, setgid, and sticky bit) in numeric mode

If I `want` to `remove` special `setuid` permissions in `numeric mode`, I would
do the `following` in `Terminal`:

```shell
chmod u-s setuid-numeric-mode-file.txt
```

If I `want` to `remove` special `setgid` permissions in `numeric mode`, I would
`do` the `following` in `Terminal`:

```shell
chmod g-s setgid-numeric-mode-file.txt
```

If I `want` to `remove` special `sticky bit` permissions in `numeric mode`, I
would `do` the `following` in `Terminal`:

```shell
chmod -t stickybit-numeric-mode-directory
```

Now `let's try` to `delete` a `file` with `sticky bit` permissions:

```shell
# hello_world.sh file permissions
-rwxrwxr-T magdala magdala 0 Jul 23 11:34 hello_world.sh
# maria user tries to delete hello-world.sh
rm hello_world.sh
# which returns:
rm: remove write-protected regular empty file 'hello_world.sh'? y # what I type for "yes"
rm: cannot remove 'hello_world.sh': Permission denied
whoami # I check to make sure who I am logged in as is as myself and not user magdala
maria
```

It is `important` to `note` that I would `not` have `been able` to `delete` this
`shell script` file `even` if I did `not` set `sticky bit` to `hello_world.sh`,
because it is `owned` by `another user`. `Only` the actual `root user` would
`be able` to `do that`.
