**_Recently_** I **_upgraded_** to `Mojave` on my `Macbook Pro` (late 2015). I
then **_decided_** it was **_also time_** to **_upgrade_** `Homebrew`. I
**_needed_** to **_update_** `postgres`, so **_thought_** I **_would update_**
`everything else`. `postgres` **_was_** a **_success_**. **_Read more_** in
`my posts` **_entitled_**
[Upgrading postgreSQL from version 10.4 to 11.1 via Homebrew (OSX)](/posts/upgrading-postgresql-from-version-104-to-111-via-homebrew-osx/)
and
[Changing your (Homebrew) postgreSQL configuration from trust to md5](/posts/changing-your-homebrew-postgresql-configuration-from-trust-to-md5/).

**_Unbeknownst_** to **_me_** until **_today_**, my `Ruby` **_system install_**
`broke` in **_the process_**. I **_hadn’t done_** `anything related` to `Ruby`
**_installations_** in a **_couple_** of **_years_**, **_and had_** to
**_refresh_** my **_memory_** on it. **_Had_** I **_installed_** with `RVM`? I
**_checked_** to **_see_** if I **_had_** it **_installed_** on **_my
computer_**. **_No_**. **_What else_** could I **_have used_** to **_manage_**
my `Ruby` **_installs_**? I **_googled_** for **_information regarding_** the
`error` I **_got_** when **_trying_** to **_watch_** a `s` on a `Node project` I
am **_working on_** in which I **_decided_** to **_switch_** from `CSS` to
`SCSS` (today). I just **_find it_** to be a much **_more efficient_** and
**_powerful way_** to **_work_** with `global styles`.

HOWEVER, when I **_wanted_** to **_go back_** and **_write about_** this
`experience` **_after_** I had **_already closed_** my `Terminal`
**_instance_**, I **_couldn’t retrieve_** the `output` or `stderr(s)` of **_my
commands_**! So I **_decided_** to **_look into_** a **_way_** of **_making
sure_** that it would **_not happen_** `again`. My **_search_** was
**_successful_**. I **_found_** a `command`(s) that would `print out`
**_either_** the `output` of a `command` or the `stderr` in `Terminal` to a
`text file` of **_my choosing_**. I **_made sure_** to **_test_** it **_before
writing_** this **_post_**, and **_it worked_**!

I **_took_** a **_simple command_**, `ruby -v`, **_which outputs_** the
(`system`) `version` of `ruby` that is **_running_** on **_my machine_** and
**_printed it_** to a **_file_** on **_my desktop_** called `ruby-output.txt`.
The **_following_** is the `command` I **8** in `Terminal`:

```shell
ruby -v 2>&1 | tee ~/desktop/ruby_output.txt
```

This **_resulted_** in **_both_** `output` to the `console` AND `output` to a
**_new file_** on my **_desktop_** called `ruby_output.txt`. If I had **_already
known_** about **_this_** `command`, I **_could have_** `re-run` the `ruby -v`
**_command_** along with **_the rest_** of this **_new command_** in `Terminal`
**_after receiving_** the `Ruby` **_related errors_** so as to **_reference_**
that **_information_** when **_writing_** my `post`! **_This time_** around I
**_went back_** to my `Google searches` to **_see_** what I had **_googled_**.
But **_in future_**, I **_will have_** a much **_more reliable_** and (time)
**_efficient solution_**!

**Important note:** If you **_want_** to **_add_** another `command output` to
the **_same file_** that **_doesn’t overwrite_** the **_previous output_**, do
NOT **_use_** this **_exact command_**. It **_will_** `overwrite` the
**_previous output_**. **_What happens_** is, a **_new file_** of the **_same
name_** `overwrites` the **_existing file_** and also `replaces` the **_previous
output_** with the **_current output_**! In **_order_** to `append` **_new
output_** without **_overwriting_** the **_previous output_**, **_use_** the
**_following command_**:

```shell
sass --watch public/styles/styles.scss >> ~/desktop/ruby_output.txt
```

**_However_**, **_nothing_** gets `output` to `Terminal`. **_Only_** to **_the
file_**! If you **_want_** to **_see_** the `output` in `Terminal` as **_well_**
as **_outputting_** to **_the file_**, **_run_** the **_following command_**:

```shell
ruby -v 2>>&1 | tee -a ~/desktop/ruby_output.tx
```

Let’s **_break_** this **_down_**. `ruby -v` is the `command` I **_wanted_** to
**_run_** in `Terminal` to **_get back_** the `system version` I am **_using_**
on my `computer`. The **_following_** is `output` in `Terminal`:

```shell
ruby 2.7.0dev (2019-01-17) [x86_64-darwin18]
```

`2` and `1` are `file descriptors`. `2` **_stands_** for `standard error`
(`stderr`), and `1` **_stands_** for `standard output` (`stdout`). **_pipe_**,
`|`, in **_this case,_** is **_used_** to **_pass_** the `stdout` or the
`stderr` to the `tee -a ~/desktop/ruby_output.txt` **_command_**. `>>`
**_means_** to **_append_**. I am **_telling_** `Terminal` to **_append_** the
`stdin` and `stdout`. If I **_only used_** `>`, then there **_would be_** an
`overwrite`, as **_shown previously_**. `tee` **_allows you_** to **_send_**
`stdout` to a **_file_** while `piping` the **_same_** `stdout` to **_another_**
`command`. **_Here_**, the **_other command_** is `-a`. `tee` is **_always
used_** with a `pipe` (`|`) **_preceding_** it.

AND it was **_also output_** to the `ruby_output.txt` **_file_** living on
`my desktop`. In **_addition_**, **_nothing_** was **_overwritten_**. The
`stdout` was simply **_appended_** to the **_rest_** of the `stdout` I **_had
added_** `previously`. The **_key_** to this is in the `-a` **_flag_**, which is
`short` for `append`. **_For example_**, this is **_what_** is **_currently
residing_** in **_that file_**:

```shell
ruby 2.7.0dev (2019-01-17) [x86_64-darwin18]
>>> Sass is watching for changes. Press Ctrl-C to stop.
ruby 2.7.0dev (2019-01-17) [x86_64-darwin18]
```

If I really wanted to get fancy, I could have done the following:

```shell
script -a ~/desktop/log-all.txt
```

I **_would start_** this `script` at the **_beginning_** of a `Terminal`
**_session_**. `script` **_means_** that I am **_starting_** a `script`
**_native_** to `Unix`, which will `print out` **_both_** `Terminal` `stdin` AND
`stdout` to a **_file_** on my **_desktop_** called `log-all.txt`. The
`default command` **_for this_** on `Linux` is `script session.log`.
**_However_**, I have **_seen_** the `log file` can be **_called anything_**
that will NOT `overwrite` some **_important_** `system file` of the **_same
name_** in the **_same location_**!!! So **_be careful_** when **_creating_** a
`script` with `script`. The **_above command_** `output` the **_following_** in
`Terminal`:

```shell
Script started, output file is /Users/mariacam/desktop/log-all.txt
```

**_Then_**, **_when_** I **_wanted_** to **_stop_** the `script`, I **_typed_**
the **_following_** in `Terminal`:

```shell
exit
```

You can **_also end_** a **_session_** with `Control + D`. **_Then all_**
`stdin` and `stdout` **_from_** `Terminal` is **_printed out_** to the
`destination file`.

But **_let’s say_** I just **_wanted_** to **_print out_** a `history` of my
**_commands_** to a **_file_**. **_This is_** actually **_what_** I **_did_**
just **_now_**:

```shell
history >> ~/desktop/history_log.txt
```

And I **_get_** my `Command Line` `history` **_printed out_** in
`history_log.txt` on `my desktop`. I am **_not sharing_** it **_here_** as
**_some_** `sensitive information` is **_logged there_**! **_Anything_** you
**_type out_** in `Command Line`, **_including_** `passwords` and such, **_will
appear_** in your `history`. So **_be careful_** about **_what kind_** of
`Command Line` **_information_** you **_share_**.

**_Some_** of the `commands` **_listed there_** I **_hadn’t_** even **_used_**
in **_AGES_**! And it **_goes up_** to the **_latest one_**, **_not including_**
those in the **_current session_**. I **_have_** to `log out` of it **_before_**
it is **_included_** in **_that_** `history`.

This is **_all well_** and **_good_**. From **_too little_** `information` to
**_too much_**! I **_like_** the `script session` **_approach_** for my
**_current purposes_** of **_committing information_** to `“printed history”`.
It **_gives me_** the **_information_** I **_need_** and **_from_** the
**_time_** I **_need_** to **_include both_** `Terminal` `stdin` and `stdout`!
Of **_course_** if I **_forget_** to **_run_** `script` at the **_beginning_**
of my `session` (and **_even later_**), and I just **_want_** to **_save_** the
`anomalies` I **_come across_**, I **_can_** just **_use_** the `command`:

```shell
ruby -v 2>>&1 | tee -a ~/desktop/ruby_output.txt
```

**_for example_**.

**_There is_** so **_much more_** on **_this topic_**. I **_highly encourage_**
`everyone` to **_delve deeper_** into `Command Line`. **_Believe me_**, it will
**_help you_** to **_become_** a much `better developer` in **_so many_**
different **_ways_**. **_Not just_** through `npm i` or `git init`, but will
**_permit you_** to **_easily retrieve_** why something **_worked_** or
**_didn’t work_** (and **_write_** an `accurate post` **_about it_**
`even after` **_logging out_** of your `Terminal` **_instance_**). And **_so
much more_**! Last **_but not_** least, it **_permits you_** to **_gain_** a
**_better understanding_** and **_control_** of **_your machine_**!
