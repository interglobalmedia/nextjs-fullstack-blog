While I was **_delving deeper_** into `Command Line` ***tonight***, I ***came across*** the **_coolest_** `command`:

```shell
say
```

***What does*** `say` ***do***? The `say` `command` ***tells*** your `computer` ***what*** to `“say”` ***back*** to ***you***! So if you **_typed_**

```shell
say Hi there Maria how are you?
```

the `computer` would **_say_** the `sentence` ***back*** to ***you***. It
[takes text as input and speaks it through its speakers](https://superuser.com/questions/223913/os-x-say-command-for-windows). Is ***that cool*** or ***what***?

*Happy chatting up with your computer!*
