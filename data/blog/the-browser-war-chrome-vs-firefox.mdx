This past week I have been talking a lot about browsers. I haven't nearly
covered everything I wanted to, especially as relates to local development, but today I came across a **_somewhat disturbing_** **article** regarding
**Chrome**. It's entitled [Review: Google Chrome has become surveillance software. It’s time to switch.](https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/06/21/google-chrome-has-become-surveillance-software-its-time-to-switch/),
written by Geoffrey A. Fowler, Washington Post columnist.

These days, you are **_damned_** if you **do**, and **_damned_** if you
**don't**. Sure, **Firefox** has all these great things they are putting in
place, but they are also the target of hackers! So which one is better, being attacked and compromised by hackers, or under surveillance by **_Uncle Sam_**?

I had heard some while back that **Google** was in league in some way with the **Government/Military**, but this is ridiculous! But not surprising. Especially regarding **_cookie tracking_**. Cookies for ads ads ads that result in the feeling of a real lack of "privacy". That business paradigm really has to change, but to what? It appears that Americans are the most apathetic on the subject! In my humble opinion, it's the **_"lazy man's way of making money"_**.

Fowler opens the article with

> You open your browser to look at the web. Do you know who is looking back at you?

He goes on to say,

> Over a recent week of web surfing, I peered under the hood of Google Chrome and found it brought along a few thousand friends. Shopping, news and even government sites quietly tagged my browser to let ad and data companies ride shotgun while I clicked around the web.
>
> This was made possible by the web’s biggest snoop of all: Google. Seen from the inside, its Chrome browser looks a lot like surveillance software.
>
> Lately I’ve been investigating the secret life of my data, running experiments to see what technology really is up to under the cover of privacy policies that nobody reads. It turns out, having the world’s biggest advertising company make the most-popular web browser was about as smart as letting kids run a candy shop. It made me decide to ditch Chrome for a new version of nonprofit Mozilla’s Firefox, which has default privacy protections. Switching involved less inconvenience than you might imagine.

I won't rehash the article here. I suggest that you read it for yourself. But considering that **GDPR** is here to say, the information shared here is
**_shocking_**, but **_not shocking_**. Now I have an even better idea of why **Google** is constantly having **_antitrust issues_**, is so hated by the Europeans, and why **GDPR** was created to begin with. As much as I love many things that **Google** provides, at the same time I am nauseated every time I read about their various **_"activities"_**. After reading the article, I decided to **_switch over_** to **Firefox** for the time being. I did make sureto **_import_** all my **Chrome Bookmarks** of course! And then maybe I will**_switch over again_** to **Safari**.
