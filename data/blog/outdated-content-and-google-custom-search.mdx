**Note 6.23.24**: This post **_refers_** to my ** iteration_** of
`interglobalmedianetwork.com` **_built_** with `GatsbyJS` (which no longer exists).

Yesterday I **_pretty much_** completed this site. There are still things to do, add, etc. But that will happen over time as needed.

There was still one very important thing I hadn't addressed. In fact, in my
opinion, it's AS IMPORTANT as the code a site is created with. However, it
**_only_** relates to sites that have been propagated from one hosting service to another AND share the same URL, **_or_** simply content that has been removed from an existing site. In my case, the site contained the same URL at the old hosting service and the new one, BUT the former was HTTP and now it is set to HTTPS. This point **_too_** is important.

![Removing outdated content from Google Search](remove-outdated-content.webp)

What am I talking about? **_Removing_** **outdated content** from **_Google
Search_**. For me this was especially important because I **_added_** **Google Custom Search** to the site. This means that people **_search_** for **content** using **Google Custom Search**, which uses **Google Search** to create **custom searches** on sites. Whatever the **_visitor_** **searches** for on the site will **_appear_** in the **Google Custom Search**, a **site's** **_customized view_** of its **content** in **Google Search**. So if a **website owner** has **_deleted_** a lot of **content** from the prior hosted version of their site or deleted from their existing site, it will STILL appear in the **_current site's_** **Google Custom Search**. **_That_** is just not very cool, right?

Perhaps those of you who are **devs** think is is a very **_rudimentary_** or **_boring_** topic. However, **_no one_** **knows** this information **_by default_**, and there are those who are **_not_** developers, who might want to know! And besides, why would they want to pay someone to do something that really is quite simple, when they could do it themselves and **_save their resources_** for **_bigger_**, **_better_**, and **_more complicated_**, **_code-related_** things they **_don't want to_** and **_can't_** **implement** themselves.

There are steps you have to take in order to take advantage of **Google's**
**_outdated content_** **feature**.

**_First_**, and **_most important_**, you **_need_** to have a **gmail
account**. This **_gains you access_** to all **Google** products. Next, you
want to make sure that you are **recognized** as the **_owner_** of your **web property** (site). I have had **web properties** via the **Google Search Console** (formerly known as **WebMaster Tools**) since 2010, when **Google WebMaster Tools** was released. I have also been using **Google Analytics** forever, so **Google** **_recognizes_** me as the **_owner_** of the **sites** I have added as properties that I own. You can also **_bypass_** **Google Analytics** and [add a web property](https://search.google.com/search-console/about) via the **Google Search Console**. I personally like to use [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/) (now programmatically improved upon by
[gtags](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/gtagjs/)) so I can know how much traffic I am getting on my site and where.

If you are already set up in some way with the [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console/about), you can immediately take advantage of the [remove outdated content](https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/6349986?hl=en) feature.

Happy **_outdated content removal_**!
