I have begun acquainting myself with `cron jobs` in `Linux`, and I want to be
able to `send` myself `local emails` inside `Linux Mint/VirtualBox` if the
`cron job` was successful or not. It is actually `quite easy`, but not so easy
to find all the correct information! But I finally did!

At first I thought that I should send an email from Linux Mint Terminal to my
actual `Gmail email`. I installed `postfix` and then `mailutils` because I was
trying out the `mail` command and needed to install `mailutils` if I wanted to
use it.

After some investigation, I found it to be too complicated and not even
necessary. There is a simple **_built-in_** `Linux` (`Mint`)
`mail user agent program` called `mailx`. According to
[Geeks for Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mailx-in-linux/),

> The `mailx `utility is an enhanced version of the `mail` command. Along with

I ended up using the `mail` command, but `mailx` is used in the same way. They
are both available with the mailutils package, which is what I installed in
order to be able to use the `mail` command. What is interesting is that mail and
mailx are two separate commands, and they have their own `bin`. But according to
[Geeks for Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mailx-in-linux/),

> Even though the mailx command is a newer version of the original mail utility,
> it can still be referenced with the ‘mail’ keyword.

In other words, they can be interchangeable. When I did try to `send` an `email`
to my `Gmail account`, of course it did `not` work. I don't think I could
accomplish that these days from a `local email address` inside my
`Linux Mint/VirtualBox` instance. So that's why I decided to stick with this
approach since I am `working inside` of a `virtual machine` anyway. It will be
interesting to find out if I can send an email to Gmail in macOS when I set up
cron jobs there. That's for another time!

I used the following `command` to `send myself` a `local email` with the `mail`
(and/or `mailx`) command from `Terminal`:

```shell
echo "My first test message" | mail -s "My first test message subject line" maria@maria-VirtualBox
# or
echo "My first test message" | mailx -s "My first test message subject line" maria@maria-VirtualBox
```

And then to `view` my local `mail/mailx` inbox, I `run` the `following` in
`Terminal`:

```shell
mail
# or
mailx
```

And when I `hit` the `Enter` key, the `following` is `output` to `Terminal`:

```shell
"/var/mail/maria": 1 message 1 unread
>U 1 Maria            Thu Jul 25 16:53  17/601  My first test message sub...
?
```

And if I want to `delete` the `message`, I `type` the `following` after the `?`
prompt:

```shell
? d 1
```

And then `hit` the `Enter` key followed by `Control key` + `D key`, which
`exits` me `out` of the `shell`. But `before` I actually `exit out`, the
`following` is `output`:

```shell
Held 0 messages in /var/mail/maria
```

The `-s` flag stands for `subject`. There are other options to choose from with
`mailx`. In order to learn more, check out `man mailx` in `Terminal`.

It is also `possible` to send emails to `other users` on the `system.` For
example, I could `send` an `email` to `user magdala`. Then I could take
advantage of things like `attaching` a `file` to the `email`. Let's say I `run`
the `following` in `Terminal`:

```shell
cat /home/maria/Desktop/history.txt | mail -s "Hi Magdala, just checking in!" magdala@maria-VirtualBox
```

Since I am `sending` the `email` via `Terminal`, and it is being `received` by
`user magdala` also via `Terminal`, I have to `stick` to `what` the `CLI`
(`Command Line Interface` or `Terminal`) understands. So for the `Terminal`
(`bash` specifically) to `interpret` the `contents` of my `history.txt` file
`properly`, I `use` the `cat` command which then becomes the `stdout` of the
`mailx` command, thereby `redirecting` the `stdin`
`cat /home/maria/Desktop/history.txt` of `mailx` as `stdout` of `mailx` to
`magdala@maria-VirtualBox`.

If I wanted to `send` a `copy` of the `email` to `myself` I `could do` the
`following`:

```shell
cat /home/maria/Desktop/history.txt | mail -s "Hi Magdala, just checking in!" magdala@maria-VirtualBox maria@maria-VirtualBox
```

And if the `user magdala` wants to `save` the `contents` to a `file`, she can
`copy` it `from` the `email body` and `paste it` into a new `.txt` file. It is
`not perfect` on the `receiving end`, but for `cron job` notification purposes,
for example, it would work just fine. As well as `.txt` files containing
`log information`, for example, that are not too lengthy.

If I did not do it as above using the `cat` command, the `contents` of the file
would be `unintelligible`.
