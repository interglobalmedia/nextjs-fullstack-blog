This series is based on a series entitled
[A Complete Beginner's Guide to Django](https://simpleisbetterthancomplex.com/series/beginners-guide/1.11/)
by Vitor Freitas on
[simpleisbetterthancomplex.com/](https://simpleisbetterthancomplex.com/) from
over 7 years ago. I have made updates to outdated code/content, added features,
and am making some changes and additions to the structure, functionality, and
design. It is thanks to him that I learned a lot I did not learn anywhere else
about Django! Check it out to compare what he did in his series and development
sequence compared to mine. I hope you will enjoy building this project, I know I
have!
