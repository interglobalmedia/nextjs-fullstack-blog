I was ***wrapping up*** my `React Workflows without Create React App` ***presentation***
using [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/#/) for the `ReactNYC meetup` this
`Thursday, September 28, 2017`, and was ***not pleased*** with the ***way*** some of my
`slide titles` ***came out***. ***Many*** of ***them*** were ***made up*** of `code`, and they ***looked*** awfully funny ***all*** in ***caps***! I had ***never*** thought about ***changing*** the **_styling_** of `css headers` ***before***. I just ***passively accepted*** that `headers` were in `caps`. But ***working*** on this ***presentation*** got me ***thinking***, `“There just has to be a better way!”`. So ***after*** a ***bit*** of ***googling***, I ***came across*** the
[first part](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/t/text-transform/) of ***my answer***:

```markdown
lowercase makes all of the letters in the selected text lowercase.

uppercase makes all of the letters in the selected text uppercase.

capitalize capitalizes the first letter of each word in the selected text.

none leaves the text's case and capitalization exactly as it was entered.

inherit gives the text the case and capitalization of its parent.
```

However, **_just adding_** `text-transform: none` to your `css headers` is not
enough. Nothing changed. So I looked a bit further, and
[this](https://kriesi.at/support/topic/remove-caps-in-headings-enfold-theme/) is
what I came up with:

```css
h1,
h2,
h3 {
    text-transform: none !important;
}
```

***And*** it ***worked***!

***Funny how*** you ***can un-earth*** the ***most precious gems*** from the ***most unlikely*** `places`! So ***this is*** what I **_added_** to ***my*** [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/#/) `custom.css`:

```css
h1,
h2,
h3,
h4,
h5,
h6 {
    text-transform: none !important;
}
```

***Now*** my ***code related*** `headings` ***look like*** what ***they are***!

And **_btw_**, if you are ***giving*** a `presentation` ***any time soon***, you should
***strongly consider*** using [reveal.md](https://github.com/webpro/reveal-md). It’s so ***awesome***!

***Happy coding!***
