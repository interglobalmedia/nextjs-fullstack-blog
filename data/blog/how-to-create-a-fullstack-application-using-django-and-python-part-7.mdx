## Building the Django Boards models

Now it is `time` to `build` the _Django Boards_ `Board`, `Topic`, and `Post`
models. The `User` model is already `included` in the built-in
`django.contrib.auth.models`, which `appears` in `INSTALLED_APPS` in
`settings.py` as `'django.contrib.auth'`.

### Model basics

A `Django` model is the `single source` of `information` about the `data` we are
`working with`. It `contains` the `necessary fields` and `functionalities` of
the `data` we are `storing`. `Each model` maps to a `single` database `table`.

-   `Each model` is a `Python` class that `subclasses` **[^1]**
    `django.db.models.Model`.
-   `Each attribute` of a `model` represents a `database field`.
-   Once we have `created` our `Django` models, `Django` automatically
    `provides` us `with` a `database-abstraction API` that `lets` us `create`,
    `get` (`read`), `update`, and `delete` objects (`CRUD` operations).

### boards/models.py

We will be `adding` the `models-related` code `inside` the `boards` app
`models.py` file:

```python
# in boards/models.py
from django.db import models
from django.contrib.auth.models import User

# Create your models here.

class Board(models.Model):
  name = models.CharField(max_length=30, unique=True)
  description = models.CharField(max_length=100)

  def __str__(self):
    return self.name

class Topic(models.Model):
  subject = models.CharField(max_length=255)
  last_updated = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
  board = models.ForeignKey(Board, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='topics')
  starter = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='topics')

class Post(models.Model):
  message = models.TextField(max_length=4000)
  topic = models.ForeignKey(Topic, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='posts')
  created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
  updated_at = models.DateTimeField(null=True)
  created_by = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='posts')
  updated_by = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE, null=True, related_name='+')
```

### The Board class model

In the `Board` class model, the `"name"` field (`class attribute`) `contains`
the `"unique"` built-in `field validation` property which is `set` to` true`.
`If` using Django's `default authentication` backend, we `can't` use a
`non-unique` username. The `name` of a `user` has `to` be `unique`.

The `description` field is simply `made up` of `alpha characters` describing the
`board`, and therefore does `not` have to be `unique`. However, one `has` to
`set` a `max_length` property. The `CharField()` method has a `max_length` of
`255` characters, but we `set` it to `100`. We `set` the `max_length` of the
`name` field to `30` characters.

We use the `__str__()` function in `Board` class to `convert` the `name object`
into its `string representation`. `def __str__(self): return self.name`
dynamically `sets` the `name` of a `board`. `When` we `write` the `code`, we
`don't` know `yet` what the `admin user` is `going` to `call` any particular
`board`. We also `have` to `return` the `name object` inside the `__str__()`
method to `make` it `available elsewhere`, `especially` in `django.contrib.auth`
where the `User` model `resides`.

### The Topic class model

In the `Topic` class `model`, we `set` the `subject` field `value` to
`models.CharField()` with a `max_length` of `255`, which is the "max"
`max_length` we can `set` to the `models.CharField()` method. There is `no need`
for `more` anyway, since the `subject line` does `not` have to `be` too `long`!

For the `last_updated` field, we `set` its `value` to
`models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)`. `Passing` the `auto_now_add=True`
option to `models.DateTimeField()` method `sets` the `current date` and `time`
`only` when the `model` (`topic`) `instance` is `created`. This is `good` for
when we `want` the `time` the `instance` was `created` to be `displayed`, like a
`"date_created"` timestamp. As `opposed` to the `auto_now` option, which would
`set` the `value` of the `last_updated` field `every time` the `model instance`
is `saved`, `regardless` of `whether` it is `being created` or `updated/saved`.

We `set` the `board` field to
`models.ForeignKey(Board, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='topics')`. We
`use` the `models.ForeignKey()` method to `define` the `many-to one`
relationship `between` the `Topic` class and the `Board` class. As `shown` in
our
[UML Class Diagram](/blog/how-to-create-a-fullstack-application-using-django-and-python-part-6#uml-class-diagram-unified-modeling-language),
there can be `0` to many (`..*`) `topics` to exactly `1` board, and a `topic`
can `only` have `exactly` one `board`. The `first option` we `pass` to the
`models.ForeignKey()` method, and `that` is a `reference` to the `Board` class.
`Why` do we just `pass` a `reference` to the `class`? Because it is `easier` to
just `reference` the class `inside` another `class`, and then just
`make changes` to the `class` being `referenced` inside the `class` itself.
`Otherwise`, if we `added` the `whole class` inside `another class`, there would
be `a lot` of `duplication` and it would be `hard` to `keep track` of and
`sync changes`.

We are `required` to `pass` the `delete_on=CASCADE` option (or `argument`) to
`models.ForeignKey()` so that `if` the `referenced object` (`model class`) is
`deleted`, then `all` the other `objects` that have a `ForeignKey` to that
`object` will `also` be `deleted`. This `makes sure` that the `child objects`
are `deleted` when the `parent object` is `deleted`.

The `related_name` option is `passed` to `models.ForeignKey()` because we are
_linking_ `Board` to `Topic` using `models.ForeignKey()`, and we `want` to
`give` a `name` to the `related_name` attribute that we `use` for the `relation`
(`reverse relationship` **[^2]**) `from` _the related_ `Board object` back to
`Topic`. `After` defining `related_name`, we can `retrieve` the `topics` of a
`board` with the `following`:

```python
board.topics.all()
```

The `starter` field which `represents` the `user` who `starts` a `topic`, is
`structured` in the `same way` as the `board` field. It is `set` to the `value`
of
`starter = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='topics')`.
We `use` the `models.ForeignKey()` method to `define` the `many-to one`
relationship `between` the `Topic` class and the `User` class. As `shown` in our
[UML Class Diagram](/blog/how-to-create-a-fullstack-application-using-django-and-python-part-6#uml-class-diagram-unified-modeling-language),
the `user` can create `0` to `many topics` (`..*`), but a `topic` can `only` be
`associated` with exactly `1` user. `Instead` of passing `Board` as the
`first argument` (option) to `models.ForeignKey()`, we are _passing_ `User`. The
`second` and `third arguments` (`options`), `on_delete` and `related_name` are
the `same`.

### The Post class model

In the `Post` class `model`, we `use` the `models.TextField()` method as the
`value` of the `message` field, and `set` the `max_length` to `4000`. `However`,
we do `not` have to `set` a `max_length` on a `TextField`, because
[Django does not enforce any size limit on a TextField in the database](https://forum.djangoproject.com/t/textfield-maximum-number-of-characters/15677).
it's `really` a `matter` of `preference`, and `whether` we `want` a `user` to be
`able` to `ramble` on and on in a `Post`.

We `set` the `value` of the `topic field` to
`models.ForeignKey(Topic, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='posts')`. We
`use` the `models.ForeignKey()` method to `define` the `many-to one`
relationship `between` the `Post` class and the `Topic` class. As `shown` in our
[UML Class Diagram](/blog/how-to-create-a-fullstack-application-using-django-and-python-part-6#uml-class-diagram-unified-modeling-language),
there has to be at least `1` to many (`..*`) `posts` to exactly `1` topic, and
one `post` can `only` have `exactly` one `topic`. The `first option` we `pass`
to the `models.ForeignKey()` method, and `that` is a `reference` to the `Topic`
class. `Why` do we just `pass` a `reference` to the `class`? Because it is
`easier` to just `reference` the class `inside` another `class`, and then just
`make changes` to the `class` being `referenced` inside the `class` itself.
`Otherwise`, if we `added` the `whole class` inside `another class`, there would
be `a lot` of `duplication` and it would be `hard` to `keep track` of and
`sync changes`.

We are `required` to `pass` the `delete_on=CASCADE` option (or `argument`) to
`models.ForeignKey()` so that `if` the `referenced object` (`model class`) is
`deleted`, then `all` the other `objects` that have a `ForeignKey` to that
`object` will `also` be `deleted`. This `makes sure` that the `child objects`
are `deleted` when the `parent object` is `deleted`.

The `related_name` option is `passed` to `models.ForeignKey()` because we are
_linking_ `Topic` to `Post` using `models.ForeignKey()`, and we `want` to `give`
a `name` to the `related_name` attribute that we `use` for the `relation`
(`reverse relationship` **[^2]**) `from` _the related_ `Topic object` back to
`Post`. `After` defining `related_name`, we can `retrieve` the `posts` of a
`topic` with the `following`:

```python
topic.posts.all()
```

The `created_at` field is `set` to `models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)`.
Passing the `auto_now_add=True` option to `models.DateTimeField()` method `sets`
the `current date` and `time` only when the `model` (`post`) `instance` is
`created`. This is `good` for when we `want` the `time` the `instance` was
`created` to be `displayed`, like a `"date_created"` timestamp. As `opposed` to
the `auto_now` option, which would `set` the `value` of the `created_at` field
`every time` the `model instance` is `saved`, `regardless` of `whether` it is
`being created` or `updated/saved`.

We set the `updated_at` field to `models.DateTimeField(null=True)`. Passing
`null=True` to `models.DateTimeField()` means that a value does not have to
initially be set to the `updated_at` field when first created. In fact, a value
never has to be set to it. A user might never update their post.

The `created_by` field is `set` to
`models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='posts')`. This
`means` that a `post` is `created` by a `user`, and if the `user` is ever
`deleted`, the `parent post` and `all` its `children` will `also` be `deleted`.
`As` already `mentioned`, `on_delete=models.CASCADE` must be `passed` to
`models.ForeignKey()`. The `related_name` option is `passed` to
`models.ForeignKey()` because we are _linking_ `User` to `Post` using
`models.ForeignKey()`, and we `want` to `give` a `name` to the `related_name`
attribute that we `use` for the `relation` (`reverse relationship` **[^2]**)
`from` _the related_ `User object` back to `Post`. `After` defining
`related_name`, we can `retrieve` the `posts` of a `topic` with the `following`:

```python
created_by.posts.all()
```

The `updated_by` field is `set` to
`models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE, null=True, related_name='+')`.
The `first argument` passed to `models.ForeignKey()` is a `reference` to the
`User` object. It is the `user` who `created` the `post` that `will` be `able`
to `update` it. However, `just like` with the `updated_at` field, `perhaps` the
`user` will `never` want to `edit/update` their `post`, so `null=True` `must` be
`passed` as the `second argument` to `models.ForeignKey()`. The
`fourth argument`, related_name='+', is new. `What` this `does` is `prevent` a
`reverse relationship` **[^2]** from `being created`. We `prevent` it from
`being created` for the `second reference` to the `User` object `passed` to
`updated_by` (the `first` is `referenced` in the `created_by` field), `because`
we `would` have to `give` a `related_name` of `"posts"` here as well, and a
`naming conflict` would `result`.

## Comparing the UML Class Fields Diagram to the models.py source code

`Below` is an `image` of the `UML Class Fields Diagram` vs the `models.py`
source code:

![UML Class Fields Diagram vs the models.py source code](uml_class_diagram_fields_code.drawio.png)

_UML Class Fields Diagram vs the models.py source code_

You might `notice` that there are _no_ `primary keys/IDs` referenced in the
`diagram`. `That` is `okay`, `because` if we `don't specify` a `primary key` for
a `model`, `Django` will `automatically generate` one `for us`.

## Migrating the models with the makemigrations command

The `next step` is to tell `Django` to `create` the `database` for `us` so we
can `start using` it.

The `makemigrations` command is `responsible` for `creating` new `migrations`
based on the `changes` we make `made` to our `models`.

The `migrate` command `applies` and `un-applies` migrations.

In `order` to `makemigrations`, I `run` the `following code` in `Terminal`
inside the `directory` that `contains` the `manage.py` file:

```shell
python3 manage.py makemigrations
```

Which `returns` something `like` the `following`:

```shell
Migrations for 'boards':
  boards/migrations/0001_initial.py
    - Create model Board
    - Create model Post
    - Create model Topic
    - Add field topic to post
    - Add field updated_by to post
```

`Since` this is our `first migration`, `Django` has `created` a `file` called
`0001_initial.py` inside the `boards/migrations/` directory, and it `represents`
the `current state` of our `boards` app's `models`. In the `next step`
(`migrate`), `Django` will `use` this `file` to create `tables` and `columns`.
The `migrations` files are `translated` into `SQL statements`. If we `want` to
`inspect` the `SQL instructions` that will be `executed` in the `database`, we
can `run` the `following` `command`:

```shell
python3 manage.py sqlmigrate boards 0001
```

## Applying the migration we generated to the database with the migrate command

`Next`, we `run` the `following command` to `apply` the `migration` we
`generated` to the `database` with the `makemigrations` command from `inside`
the `directory` that `houses` the `manage.py` file:

```shell
python3 manage.py migrate
```

Which `returns` something `like` the `following` in `Terminal`:

```shell
Operations to perform:
  Apply all migrations: admin, auth, boards, contenttypes, sessions
Running migrations:
  Applying contenttypes.0001_initial... OK
  Applying auth.0001_initial... OK
  Applying admin.0001_initial... OK
  Applying admin.0002_logentry_remove_auto_add... OK
  Applying contenttypes.0002_remove_content_type_name... OK
  Applying auth.0002_alter_permission_name_max_length... OK
  Applying auth.0003_alter_user_email_max_length... OK
  Applying auth.0004_alter_user_username_opts... OK
  Applying auth.0005_alter_user_last_login_null... OK
  Applying auth.0006_require_contenttypes_0002... OK
  Applying auth.0007_alter_validators_add_error_messages... OK
  Applying auth.0008_alter_user_username_max_length... OK
  Applying boards.0001_initial... OK
  Applying sessions.0001_initial... OK
```

`Because` this is the `first time` we are `migrating` the `database`, the
`migrate` command also `applied` the existing `migration` files from the
`django.contrib` apps in `INSTALLED_APPS` in `settings.py`.

`Applying sessions.0001_initial... OK` is the `migration` we `generated` in the
`previous step`. `Now` our `database` is `ready` to be `used`.

**Note about SQLLite**: `SQLite` IS a `production` quality `database`, but
`just` for `small sites`. `PostgreSQL` or `Oracle`, `High-volume websites`,
`write-intensive applications`, very `large datasets`, `high concurrency`, all
`should` not `use` SQLite. `While` we are `developing` the `site` locally,
`using` the `SQLLite` database that `comes` with `Django` is `perfectly fine`.
`But` when we `deploy` our `site` to `production`, we will `switch` to
`PostgreSQL`. For `simple websites` like the `one` we are `building`, it is
`okay` to `switch` from `SQLite` to another `database`, but `with` more
`complex sites`, `one` should `use` the `same database` in `development` and
`production`.

## Tinkering with the Models API

`Python3` has an `interactive shell` we can `use` during `Python` development.
It's a `great way` to `try` new `things` and `experiment` with
`Python libraries` and `APIs`.

The `following` command `starts up` the `Python3 shell` in `Terminal`:

```shell
python3 manage.py shell
```

The command `returns` the `following`:

```shell
Python 3.12.5 (main, Aug 26 2024, 07:35:37) [Clang 15.0.0 (clang-1500.3.9.4)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
(InteractiveConsole)
>>>
```

This is `similar` to `simply` running `python3`, which `returns`:

```shell
Python 3.12.5 (main, Aug 26 2024, 07:35:37) [Clang 15.0.0 (clang-1500.3.9.4)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>
```

`When` I run `python3`, it `starts` the
[Python interpreter](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37003872/in-django-what-is-the-difference-between-running-python-manage-py-shell-or-ju).
Running `python3 manage.py shell` within a `Django` project `sets` the
`DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` environment variable, `which` provides `Django` with
the `Python` import `path` to my `django_boards/settings.py` file. This `means`
I can `do` the `following` within the `Python3 shell` instead of in `models.py`:

```shell
(InteractiveConsole)
>>>from boards.models import Board
```

Then I can `create` a `new` board `object`:

```shell
>>>board = Board(name="Django Models", description="This board is all about Django Models.")
```

To `persist` this `object` in the `database`, I `run` the `following command`:

```shell
board.save()
```

The `save()` method both `creates` and `updates` objects. `Here`, it `created` a
new `board`, and `once` the `object` is `saved` to the `database`, `Django`
automatically `gives` it an `id`. So `when` I `run`:

```shell
board.id
```

`Something like` the `following` is `returned`:

```shell
4
```

`In` my `case`, I `already created` 3 `boards`, so this is `board` number `4`. I
can `also` access `all` the other `board` attributes. The `board` name for
`example`:

```shell
board.name
```

Which `returns`:

```shell
'Django Models'
```

And the `board` description:

```shell
board.description
```

Which `returns`:

```shell
'This board is all about Django Models.'
```

I can also `modify` (`update`) the `board` description:

```shell
board.description = "This board covers Django Models."
```

when I run `board.description` again, the `following` is `returned`:

```shell
'This board covers Django Models.'
```

And then, if I `want` to `save` these `changes`, I `have` to run `board.save()`
again.

## The Django Model Manager

According to the `Django` documentation,

> A Manager is a Django class that provides the interface between database query
> operations and a Django model.

The `Manager` interacts with the `database`. When we `want` to retrieve
`objects` from the `database`, we `need` to `construct` a `QuerySet` via the
`Manager` on our `model class`. `By default`, the `Manager` is `available`
through the `Model.objects` property. This `Manager` is the
`django.db.models.Manager`.

We can use `django.db.models.Manager` directly to `create` a `new` Board
`object` via the `Python3 shell`:

```shell
board = Board.objects.create(name="Python Objects", description="Where we discuss everything about Python objects.")
```

`Then` I run `board.save()` to `save` this new `board instance` to the
`database`. `After that`, when I run `board.id`, the `following` is `returned`:

```shell
5
```

Now I `have` 5 `boards`. If you `want` to `catch up` with `me` and `create` more
`boards`, it `would` be `great practice`!

`Next`, if I run `Board.objects.all()`, the `following` is `returned` in the
`shell`:

```shell
<QuerySet [<Board: Python>, <Board: Django>, <Board: Random>, <Board: Django Models>, <Board: Python Objects>]>
```

The `above` is a `QuerySet`. A `QuerySet` is a `collection` of `data` from a
`database`. A `QuerySet` is `basically` a `list` of `objects` from the
`database`. `Here`, we are `able` to `read` the `actual names` of the `Boards`.
`That` is `because` of the `__str__()` method `inside` the `Board` model in
`models.py`:

```python
class Board(models.Model):
  name = models.CharField(max_length=30, unique=True)
  description = models.CharField(max_length=100)

  def __str__(self):
    return self.name
```

As mentioned in [the Board class model](#the-board-class-model) section, we use
the `__str__()` function in `Board` class to `convert` the `name object` into
its `string representation`. `def __str__(self): return self.name` dynamically
`sets` the `name` of a `board`. `When` we `write` the `code`, we `don't` know
`yet` what the `admin user` is `going` to `call` any particular `board`. We also
`have` to `return` the `name object` inside the `__str__()` method to `make` it
`available elsewhere`, `especially` in `django.contrib.auth` where the `User`
model `resides`. If we hadn't yet added the `__str__()` function, the following
would be returned in the QuerySet:

```shell
<QuerySet [<Board: Board object>, <Board: Board object>, <Board: Board object>, <Board: Board object>, <Board: Board object>]>
```

### Treating the QuerySet like a list

We can _treat_ `QuerySets` like `lists`. If we `want` to `iterate over` all our
`Board.objects`, we can `run` the `following` in the `Python3 shell`:

```shell
>>>boards_list = Board.objects.all()
>>>for board in boards_list:
...    print(board.description)
...
Everything related to Python
This is a board about Django.
Discuss anything.
This board covers Django Models.
Where we discuss everything about Python objects.
>>>
```

We can `also use` the `Model manager` to `return` a `single object`. For that we
`use` the `get()` method:

```shell
django_board = Board.objects.get(id=3)
```

`Then` I run `django_board.name`, and it `returns` the `following`:

```shell
'Random'
```

`Which` is the `name` of the `board` with the `id` of `'3'`.

`On` the `other hand`, if we `try` to `get` an `object` with a `non-existent id`
in the `shell`, an `exception` will be `thrown`. For example, `if` I `try` to
`get` a `board` with an `id` of `6` (`no` such `id` in `my case`),
`something like` the following `happens`:

```shell
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<console>", line 1, in <module>
  File "/Users/mariacam/.pyenv/versions/3.12.5/lib/python3.12/site-packages/django/db/models/manager.py", line 87, in manager_method
    return getattr(self.get_queryset(), name)(*args, **kwargs)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/mariacam/.pyenv/versions/3.12.5/lib/python3.12/site-packages/django/db/models/query.py", line 649, in get
    raise self.model.DoesNotExist(
boards.models.Board.DoesNotExist: Board matching query does not exist.
```

We can `use` the `get()` method with any `model` field, but it is `better` to
get the `model instance` with a `field` that can `uniquely identify` the
`object`, like an `id` or a `unique name`. `Otherwise`, the `query` might return
`more` than `one object`, which `would` also `cause` an `exception`.

`get()` queries are also `case sensitive`. If a `board` name is `'Random'`, for
example, `but` I `run` the `following`:

```shell
Board.objects.get(name="random")
```

`Something like` the `following` is `returned`:

```shell
 File "<console>", line 1, in <module>
  File "/Users/mariacam/.pyenv/versions/3.12.5/lib/python3.12/site-packages/django/db/models/manager.py", line 87, in manager_method
    return getattr(self.get_queryset(), name)(*args, **kwargs)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/mariacam/.pyenv/versions/3.12.5/lib/python3.12/site-packages/django/db/models/query.py", line 649, in get
    raise self.model.DoesNotExist(
boards.models.Board.DoesNotExist: Board matching query does not exist.
```

`But` if I `run`:

```shell
Board.objects.get(name="Random")
```

The `following` is `returned`:

```shell
<Board: Random>
```

| Operation                                  | Code Sample                                         |
| ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Create an object without saving            | board = Board()                                     |
| Save an object (create or update)          | board.save()                                        |
| Create and save an object in the database  | Board.objects.create(name='...', description='...') |
| List all objects                           | Board.objects.all()                                 |
| Get a single object, identified by a field | Board.objects.get(id=1)                             |

## Conclusion

In this section, I discussed the Django model basics, I compared the UML Class
Fields Diagram to the models.py source code, I migrated the models with the
makemigrations command, applied the model migrations with the migrate command,
played with the Models API, and discussed the Django Model manager.

## Footnotes

**[^1]**: An `example` of sub-classing `django.db.models.Model` in the `Board`,
`Topic`, and `Post` classes in the `boards` app `code` is:

```python
# in models.py
from django.db import models

class Board(models.Model):
  ...
class Topic(models.Model):
  ...
class Post(models.Model):
```

**[^2]**: For a `reverse relationship` refresher, please `visit` the
[UML Class Diagram which visualizes fields (and not relationships)](/blog/how-to-create-a-fullstack-application-using-django-and-python-part-6#uml-class-diagram-which-visualizes-fields-and-not-relationships)
`section` in `part 6` of this `series`.
