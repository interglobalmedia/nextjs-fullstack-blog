## The xcodebuild -version command

Recently I `had` to `update` xCode, because the `version` I was `using` was too
old. I had `version` 15.1 beta, but the `latest` is now `version` 16.0 beta.

When I ran the `xcodebuild -version` command `before` I `upgraded` xCode, the
`following` was `returned`:

```shell
xcode-select: error: tool 'xcodebuild' requires Xcode, but active developer directory'/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools' is a command line tools instance
```

I `checked` the `current version` of `xCode`, and it was `16.0`. It was `time`
to `upgrade`.

I `downloaded` the `latest version`, `moved` the `current version` which
`resided` in `Applications` to the `trash`, and `moved` the `new version` into
`Applications`.

## The echo command and the special $? variable

`In order` to doubly `make sure` that I had `successfully` installed `xCode`
version `16.0 beta`, I `ran` the `following command`:

```shell
xcodebuild -version; echo "# exit code: $?"
```

And the `following` was `returned` in Terminal:

```shell
Xcode 16.0
Build version 16A5230g
# exit code: 0
```

The `first` two `lines` are the `result` of `xcodebuild -version`. The `;`
(`semi-colon`) `separates` the `xcodebuild -version` command `from` the
`echo "# exit code: $?"` command.

`# exit code: 0` is the `result` of the `echo "# exit code: $?"` command.

### The echo command and what it does

The `echo `command is `used` to `display` a `line` of `text` or `string` that is
`passed` as an `argument` to `echo`. It is `used` in `scripts` and `Terminal`
commands to `output` text as `stdout` in `Terminal`. Here, `"# exit code: $?"`
is the `string` argument `passed` to `echo`.

### The $? special variable and what it means

`$?` is a `special variable` in the (current) shell (`zsh`, for example) that
`stores` the `exit status` of the `last command` that was `executed`. The
`exit status` is a `numerical value` returned by the `command` to `indicate`
whether it `succeeded` or `failed`. If a `0` is `returned`, the `command` was
`successful`. If a `1` is `returned`, the command `failed`.

`xcodebuild -version;` is the `last command` before the `echo` command that was
`executed`. Therefore, the `exit code` stored in `$?` is `that` of the
`xcodebuild -version;` command. And since `0` is `returned`, it `means` that
`installation` of xCode `16.0 beta` was `successful`.

I `also` could have `run` this `command` before I `installed` the
`latest version` of `xCode`, and `in` that `case`, an `exit code` of `1` would
`have` been `returned`, which would `mean` that `CommandLineTools` was
`configured` instead of `xCode`, as `indicated` in the `stdout` of the initial
`xcodebuild -version;` command to `Terminal`.
