I have been wracking my brain lately as to how to engage team members more via
live code collaboration. This extends to both the classroom and work.

The first thing you have to do is to install Live Share by Microsoft. Go to the extensions icon all the way to the left of the VS Code window and click on it. For me, it is six icons down from the top:

If you hover over each icon, you will see what it is for.

When you click on the extensions icon, the following view will appear:

Next, click on the first Live Share extension that appears at the top. It should look like this:

Then click on the install button. After it has been installed, reload VS Code.

If you want to share a particular project with others, first you have to make
sure that they have a Github account (that is the account we will be using to
connect, not Microsoft).

When you restart VS Code, and are also already logged into Github, you should
see the Live Share icon along with your others all the way to the left of the VS Code window instance. If you click on it, the following will appear:

However, if you open the `Command Palette` by **_pressing_** the `Shift` key +
`Ctrl` key + `P` key. And then **_type_** `Live Share`, you will have **_even
more_** options **available** to **_you_**:

In the `screenshot` above, I was **_not able_** to `show` the **_complete
list_** of `options`. You will **_see_** if the `scroll bar` for the
`Command Palette` has any more **_scrolling_** to do, and you can check out the rest of the options available that way.

Next, you should see `Live Share` **_appear_** at the **bottom** of your
`VS Code` window. Click on it. It will **start** a **_new_** session:

If you are **_part_** of a `Discord Server` (`group`) and would like to
**_invite others_** from that `group`, you simply **_paste_** the link
**_either_** in one of the `Group channels` or **_within_** a `DM` to
**_particular people_**. When they **_click_** on the `link`, they will be
**_prompted_** what to do. It is **_very important_** that you are **_actually
in_** the `folder` you want to **_collaborate_** with others on **_inside_** of `VS Code` **_before_** you **start** a `session`, **_otherwise_** others will **_not_** be able to `collaborate` **_inside_** the `folder`. They will see **_nothing_**.

If you want to **_stop_** a `session`, `click` on your (`Live Share`) `name`
**_located_** at the `bottom` the `VS Code` **window instance**, and the
`VS Code Command Palette` will **_open_**. When it does, **_select_**
`Stop Collaboration Session`.

To **_learn more_** about `Live Share`, please **_visit_** the
`Microsoft VS Code` documentation: 

- [Microsoft VS Code Live Share Documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/learn/collaboration/live-share)

The **_only difference_** between the `installation` we will be **using** called `Live Share` and the `Microsoft documentation` in which they **_describe_** the `Live Share Extension Pack` (do **_not_** try to install it because the `Audio` portion does **_not_** work and will \***_result_** in a **failed** `Live Share` installation). **_Everything else_** is the **_same_**.

It is **_really worth_** `getting` to `know` this `tool` so that you all can
**_collaborate live_** from **_within_** your `VS Code` text editors.
