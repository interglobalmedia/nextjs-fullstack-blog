## Exchanging PHP key pairs recap

`In` my `article` entitled
[Exchanging public keys using a PGP key pair](/blog/exchanging-keys-using-a-pgp-key-pair),
I `discussed`:

1. Exporting the PGP public key
1. Sending maria_publickey.asc to another local user via email
1. Email recipient user magdala imports the maria_publickey.asc
1. Signing the imported public key maria_publickey.asc
1. Exporting magdala_publickey.asc
1. Creating the revocation certificate for magdala PGP key pair
1. Immediately changing permissions for revocation.crt
1. Emailing magdala_publickey.asc to user Maria
1. User Maria imports magdala_publickey.asc
1. Asymmetric encryption and decryption series

Basically, the `exchange` of `public keys` with a `trusted person` makes it
`possible` to then `send` and `receive` encrypted `emails` (or
`email attachments`) `to` and `from` that `person`, and `decrypt` those `emails`
(or `email attachments`) as well. If you `have not` already `generated` a
`PGP key` using `GnuPG` (`GNU Privacy Guard`), please `visit` my `article`
entitled
[Making and verifying digital signatures using GPG in Linux](/blog/making-and-verifying-digital-signatures-using-gpg-in-linux).
And `make sure` to `check out` my entire
`Asymmetric encryption and decryption series`.

## Sending and receiving encrypted emails from another local user in Linux with whom you have exchanged public PGP keys (Maria sends and Magdala receives)

`Since` user `magdala` and I have `exchanged` PGP `public keys`, `we` are
`ready` to `send` each other `encrypted content` via `email` and `decrypt` the
`content` we `receive` from `each other`.

`First`, I `created` a `file` called `encrypted_message.txt` and `added` some
`plaintext` to `it`:

```shell
echo This is some dummy text that I am going to encrypt for my email encryption demo. > encrypted_message.txt
```

`Next`, I `ran` the `following command` in `Terminal` to `encrypt` the
`encrypted_message.txt` file which I then `sent` to `user magdala`:

```shell
gpg --encrypt --recipient magdala@maria-VirtualBox --output confidential.txt.enc encrypted_message.txt
```

`And` it `returned` the `following`:

```shell
gpg: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx: There is no assurance this key belongs to the named user

sub rsa/3072/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx 2024-08-14 magdala (This is the second PGP key pair I am creating for local testing because I lost the passphrase for the first one) <magdala@maria-VirtualBox>
  Primary key fingerprint: xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx
       Subkey fingerprint: xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx

It is NOT certain that the key belongs to the person named in the user ID. If you "really" know what you are doing, you may answer the next question with yes.

use this key anyway? (y/N) y
```

And `when` I `hit` the `Return` key and then ran `ls` on the `current directory`
I was `in` (`Desktop` in this `case`), `the` following `new file` appeared:

```shell
confidential.txt.enc
```

`Next`, I could `send` this `encrypted file` to `magdala`. The `reason` for
`magdala`'s `email` in the `command` is `that` it identifies `magdala`'s
`public key` for `me` when `encrypting` the `encrypted_message.txt` file.

I then `ran` the `following command` in `Terminal` which would send
`confidential.txt.enc` as an `email attachment` to `user magdala`:

```shell
mutt -s 'Sending encrypted file confidential.txt.enc' -a confidential.txt.enc -- magdala@maria-VirtualBox
```

I was then `taken` into the `mutt` interface where I `completed` the `email` and
`sent` it. If you `need` a `refresher` on the `process`, please `visit` my
`article` entitled
[Setting up and using the mutt email client in Linux](/blog/setting-up-and-using-the-mutt-email-client-in-linux).

`Next`, `user` magdala `opened up` the `email` and `saved` the
`email attachment` to her `local machine`. `After` she `did that`, `she` was
`ready` to `decrypt` the `file`:

```shell
gpg --decrypt --output decrypted_message.txt confidential.txt.enc
```

When `user` magdala `hit` the `Return` key, `she` wass `prompted` for her
`PGP key pair` passphrase.

`After` she `successfully input` her `passphrase` and `hit` the `"Ok"` button,
the `following` was `stdout` to `Terminal`:

```shell
gpg: encrypted with rsa3072 key, ID xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx, created 2024-08-14
    "magdala (This is the second PGP key pair I am creating for local testing because I lost the passphrase for the first one) <magdala@maria-VirtualBox>"
```

`Using` magdala's `public key`, I successfully `encrypted` the file
`encrypted_message.txt` and `stdout` the `encrypted contents` into a `new file`
called `confidential.txt.enc` (`.enc` stands for `"encrypted"`), and then `sent`
the `confidential.txt.enc` as an `email attachment` to `user magdala`.

`User magdala` then `opened up` the `email` and `saved` the email attachment
`confidential.txt.enc` to her `local machine`. She then `successfully` decrypted
`confidential.txt.enc` using her `private key`.

And that was it!

## Sending and receiving encrypted emails from another local user in Linux with whom you have exchanged public PGP keys (Magdala sends and Maria receives)

Now `user` magdala `created` a `file` called `secret_message.txt` containing
`plaintext` using the `following command`:

```shell
gpg --encrypt --recipient mariaa@maria-VirtualBox --output super-secret.txt.enc secret_message.txt
```

And `when` she `hit` the `Return` key and ran `ls` on her
`current working directory` (her `/home/magdala` directory in `this case`), a
`new file` called `super_secret.txt.enc` appeared.

`Next`, she `sent` a `message` to `me`, `user Maria`, `attaching` the
`super-secret.txt.enc` file as an `email attachment` using the `mutt` Command
Line `email client`:

```shell
mutt -s 'Sending encrypted file super_secret.txt.enc' -a super_secret.txt.enc -- maria@maria-VirtualBox
```

`When` she `hit` the `Return` key, she was `taken` into the `mutt interface`,
`completed` her `email`, and `sent` it to `me`.

`Next`, I `opened up` the `mutt interface` by running the `mutt` command, hit
the `V` key to `view` my `email`, then `selected` the `attachment` by using the
`Up` or `Down` arrow `key`, then `hit` the `S` key to `save` the `attachment` to
my `local machine`, and then `hit` the `Q` key to `quit mutt`.

`Next`, I `ran` the `following command` to `decrypt` the `super_secret.txt.enc`
file:

```shell
gpg --decrypt --output decrypted_super_secret.txt super_secret.txt.enc
```

`When` I `hit` the `Return` key, I was `prompted` to `enter` my `PGP key pair`
passphrase. When I `successfully` provided it, the `following` was `returned` as
`stdout` to `Terminal`:

```shell
gpg: encrypted with rsa3072 key, ID xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx, created 2024-08-09
    "Maria (GPG key pair for local testing with correct email) <maria@maria-VirtualBox>"
```

Then `when` I `ran` the `ls` command on the `current working directory`, the
`new` file `decrypted_super_secret.txt` appeared. And `when` I ran
`cat decrypted_super_secret.txt`, the `following` was `stdout` to `Terminal`:

```shell
This is some super secret text I am creating so I can send an encrypted version of it to my friend Maria so that no one else knows what I am sending her!
```

## Running the diff -s command to check if the contents of two files are identical

If `user magdala` and `I` wanted to be `extra certain` that the `content` of the
`encrypted` email `attachment` was `not modified` during `transmission` of the
`email`, either of us `could` have `run` the `diff -s` command `between` her
`plaintext file` and `mine`. `One` of `us` just `had` to `send` our
`plaintext file` to the `other` so that `either` of `us` had both `files` to
`compare` to `each other`.

So `user` magdala `sent me` her `original` plaintext `file` via `mutt`, I
`saved` it to my `local machine`, and `then` I `ran` the `following command`:

```shell
diff -s secret_message.txt decrypted_super_secret.txt
```

Which `returned` the `following` in `Terminal`:

```shell
Files secret message.txt and decrypted_super_secret.txt are identical
```

## Generating sha512sum checksum hashes to check if the contents of two files are identical

I `could` also `generate` a `sha512sum checksum` on both `secret message.txt`
and `decrypted_super_secret.txt`, and `if` the `hashes` matched, `user magdala`
and `I` would `know` that there were `no` modifications `made` to the
`original plaintext` or the `decrypted plaintext`, which would also `mean` that
`both matched`.

`First` I `ran` the `following command` on the `secret message.txt` file:

```shell
sha512sum secret message.txt
```

And the `following` was `returned` in `Terminal`:

```shell
b5ab6a7aa7250c2687cc058c6dd01ce88dc99d79804ab63903b99756d19f88b9b33f375731979dd44eb1c2f155681fbbb7a1ba57d0ea2f905b1af2a94edf2cbd  secret_message.txt
```

`Then` I `ran` the `following command` on the `decrypted_super_secret.txt` file:

```shell
sha512sum decrypted_super_secret.txt
```

And the `following` was `returned` in `Terminal`:

```shell
b5ab6a7aa7250c2687cc058c6dd01ce88dc99d79804ab63903b99756d19f88b9b33f375731979dd44eb1c2f155681fbbb7a1ba57d0ea2f905b1af2a94edf2cbd  decrypted_super_secret.txt
```

`Then` I `redirected` the `stdout` of `sha512sum secret message.txt` to a
`new file` called `sha512sum_secret_message.txt`:

```shell
sha512sum secret message.txt > sha512sum_secret_message.txt
```

And `then` I `redirected` the `stdout` of `sha512sum decrypted_super_secret.txt`
to a `new file` called `sha512sum_decrypted_super_secret.txt`:

```shell
sha512sum decrypted_super_secret.txt > sha512sum_decrypted_super_secret.txt
```

## Using the cmp command to compare the contents of two files

`Next`, I `compared` the `two` newly created `files` containing the
`file hashes` with the `following commands` to `see` if they were `identical`:

```shell
cmp -s sha512sum_secret_message.txt sha512sum_decrypted_super_secret.txt
echo $?
# which returns:
0
```

The `cmp` command `compares` two `files` byte by byte. The `-s` option, or
`--quiet` or `--silent`, `suppresses` all `output`. And since `-s` suppresses
`all output`, I ran `echo $?` afterwards, which `printed out` the `exit code`.
Specifically, `$?` is a `special variable` which means
`execution status of the last command`. An `exit code` of `0`, `as` shown
`here`, `means` the `contents` of `both files` are `the same`. `1` would `mean`
that `they` are `different`.

And that was it!
