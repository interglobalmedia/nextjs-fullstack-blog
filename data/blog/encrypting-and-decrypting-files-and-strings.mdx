This **post** was **_originally published_** on
[Github](https://github.com/interglobalmedia/encrypt-decrypt-files-python).

**Note**: this process does not take into account an actual recipient of the
message who would normally decrypt the message. I will take that into account in
a future post.

## Python Vs Command Line

In cybersecurity, we want to be as efficient and swift as possible when
executing our tasks. In this scenario, I want to compare encrypting and
decrypting files and strings in Python vs doing the same thing via the Command
Line.

First of all, in my `Python` **_approach_** to `encrypting` and `decrypting` a
**_file_**, I wanted to make sure that I `modularized` my `task functions`. So I
**_created_** the **_following_** `files`:

-   create_key.py
-   get_key.py
-   encrypt_file.py
-   decrypt_file.py

As for `encrypting` and `decrypting` a `string`, I **_created_** the
**_following_** `files`:

-   encrypt_string.py
-   decrypt_string.py

**_Now_** to **_break_** `things` **_down_** and **_explain_** `what` **_each_**
`file` **_does_**. I **_tried_** to **_create_** `file names` that
**_describe_** the `individual tasks` they are **_responsible_** for. I call
this `"task modularization"`.

The `create_key.py` file **_creates_** an `encryption key` **_using_** the
`Python Fernet` **_symmetric encryption method_**. It was **_created_** by
`Google` and **_uses_** `128-bit AES keys`. `AES 128-bit encryption` in of
**_itself_** is **_safe against_** `brute-force attacks`. **_The only_**
`"wildcard"` is the **_safety_** of the `key`. I **_would say_** that
**_using_** `symmetric encryption` is **_best when_** you are `encrypting` and
`decrypting` **_for yourself_** and **_don't need_** to **_share_** the `key`
**_with others_** for `successful completion` of the **_process_**.

The `get_key.py` file's `task` is to **_load_** the `key` that has been
`generated`. So **_for example_**, I **_make_** the **_following_**
`import statement` in the `decrypt_file.py`, `decrypt_string.py`,
`encrypt_file.py`, `encrypt_string.py`:

```python
from get_key import load_key
```

**_And_** I **_also make_** the **_following_** `import statement` for
`Python Fernet` **_in all_** the `files` **_except for_** `get_key.py`:

```python
from get_key import load_key
```

All `get_key.py` **_does_** is **_load_** the `key.key` file **_which
contains_** the `encryption key` **_itself_**, so **_importing_** `Fernet`, or
**_anything else_** for **_that matter_**, is **_not necessary_**.

The **_difference between_** the `code` for `encrypting` and `decrypting` a
**_file_** was **_minimal_** and **_therefore easy_** to **_set_** up
**_modularly_**. It was a **_bit trickier_**, **_however_**, with the
**_creation_** of the `message_encrypt` and `message_decrypt` functions.
**_There_**, I **_had_** to **_make sure_** that the `string` which is
`encrypted` is the **_same string_** that is then `decrypted`.

In the `encrypt_string.py` file, I **_had_** to **_make sure_** that I
**_created_** a `local variable` **_inside_** the `message_encrypt`
**_function_** that I **_would_** be **_able_** to `import` **_into the_**
`decrypt_string.py` file and then **_use inside_** the `message_decrypt`
**_function_**. So:

```python
# store string in variable
message = 'super secret message'
# inside the message_encrypt function
# encrypt data
message_encrypt.message_encrypted = f.encrypt(message.encode())
```

`message_encrypt` is the **_name_** of the **_function_**, and
`message_encrypted` is the `variable name`. This **_made_** it **_possible_** to
**_include_** the **_following_** `import statement` **_inside_** the
`decrypt_string.py` file:

```python
from encrypt_string import message_encrypt
```

**_And this_** then **_made it_** possible **_to add_** the **_following_**
inside the `message_decrypt` function **_thereby linking_** the
`encrypted message` **_created_** in `encrypt_string.py` to the
`encrypted message` **_imported from_** the `encrypt_string.py` file into
`decrypt_string.py`, which **_resulted in_** the **_successful_** `decryption`
**_of the_** `encrypted message` (`string`):

```python
from encrypt_string import message_encrypt
# inside the message_decrypt function
message_encrypt.message_encrypted = f.decrypt(message_encrypt.message_encrypted.decode())
```

The above **_prevents_** the **_following_** `error` **_from_** `taking place`
in `Terminal` **_when running_** the **_string related_** files **_containing_**
the `modularized functions`:

```python
File "/Users/mariacam/Development/cyber-projects/encrypt-decrypt-files-python/venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages/cryptography/fernet.py", line 86, in decrypt
    timestamp, data = Fernet._get_unverified_token_data(token)
                      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/mariacam/Development/cyber-projects/encrypt-decrypt-files-python/venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages/cryptography/fernet.py", line 119, in _get_unverified_token_data
    raise InvalidToken
```

**_Lastly_**, it is **_important_** to **_note that_** in the `message_decrypt`
**_function_**, the `message` **_represented by_**
`message_encrypt.message_encrypted` **_passed_** to the `f.decrypt()` method, is
**_chained_** to the `decode()` method **_instead of_** the `encode()` method.
**_Not only_** are we `decrypting` our `message`, but we **_also have_** to
`decode` it, **_since_** it was `encoded` when `encrypted`. **_Now_** the
`message` is just `"plain text"` as it was **_originally_** when **_first
created_**.

## Using GnuPG to encrypt and decrypt strings and files via the Command Line

This was **_a lot_** of **_work_**, right? A `programmatic approach` **_will
always_** be **_more complex_** than `executing` the **_same task_** via the
`Command Line`. And in `Cybersecurity`, we **_won't_** necessarily **_have_**
the `luxury` or `even need` to `programmatically execute` **_such tasks_**.

**_This_** is **_where_** `tools` **_such as_** `gnupg` **_come in_**. `gnupg`,
**_aka_** `gpg`, which **_stands for_** [GNU Privacy Guard](https://gnupg.org/),
is

> RFC4880 (also known as PGP). GnuPG allows you to encrypt and sign your data

## Encrypting a file with GnuPG

**_Next_**, I **_installed_** `gpg` **_using_**
[Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/gnupg) so I could **_use it_** to
`encrypt` and `decrypt` a `file`. If you **_have_** `Homebrew` **_already
installed_** on your `macOS`, but **_don't have_** `gnupg` **_installed_**,
**_run_** the **_following command_** in `Terminal`:

```shell
brew install gnupg
```

If you **_think that_** you **_might have_** it **_installed_**, **_run_** the
**_following command_** in `Terminal`:

```shell
gpg --version
```

If you **_get back_** something like the **_following_**:

```shell
gpg (GnuPG) 2.4.3
```

Then you **_do have_** it **_installed_**. **_But_** if you **_get back_**:

```shell
zsh: command not found: gpg
```

You **_do not_** have it **_installed_**.

If you are on `Linux`, you **_would_** `use` the **_following command_** to
**_install_** `gpg` **_using_** the `package manager` **_of your_**
`Linux distribution`:

```shell
sudo apt install gnupg
```

**_After_** `gnupg` was **_installed_**, I **_ran_** the **_following command_**
in `Terminal`:

```shell
echo Hello Maria! > greetings.txt
```

**Note**: **_On_** `macOS`, **_when_** we **_run_** the `echo` command, we
**_should not_** `use quotes` **_around_** the `string` of `words`. It
**_throws_** an `error`.

**_Then_** I **_ran_** the `gpg` command to `encrypt` my **_new_**
`greetings.txt` file, and I **_included_** the **_use_** of a `passphrase`. I
even **_use them_** when **_communicating_** with `Github`, **_even though_** I
am **_connected_** via `SSH`. **_So_**:

```shell
gpg --batch --output greetings.txt.gpg --passphrase mypassword --symmetric greetings.txt
```

`mypassword` should be **_replaced with_** your **_actual_** `passphrase` value.
This command **_creates_** the `encrypted` file `greetings.txt.gpg` in the
**_same location_** as `greetings.txt` using its **_default_**
`AES256 algorithm`.
[As for the --batch option, with GPG2](https://superuser.com/questions/972204/how-to-use-gnupg-with-passphrase),
**_which is_** what `GPG 2.4.3` is (`Homebrew` **_links_** `GPG` to `GPG2`), you
**_have_** to **_use_** it **_with_** the --passphrase option.

**_After_** I **_executed_** this command, the **_following_** was
**_returned_** in `Terminal`:

```shell
gpg: WARNING: unsafe permissions on homedir '/Users/mariacam/.gnupg'
```

**_First_**, to **_make sure_** that the `.gnupg` directory and its `contents`
is **_accessible_** to me, I **_run_** the **_following command_**:

```shell
chown -R $(whoami) ~/.gnupg
```

The `chown` command **_changes_** the `file ownership` of a **_specific_**
`file` or `folder`. **_Here_**, it **_pertains to_** the `.gnupg` folder in my
`home directory`. `whoami` **_refers to_** the `current user`, **_which_** in
**_my case_**, is `me`, and **_refers to_** the `current user`'s `username` on
the `system`. `-R` **_indicates_** that `ownership` of a `folder` is **_being
changed_**. In **_my case_**, this is **_simply_** a `confirmation` of
`ownership`, **_since_** I am the **_only user_** on **_my computer_**.

**_But_** this was **_not enough_**. I l**_ike_** to **_make sure_**, **_even
though_** there are **_no other_** `users` at **_this time_** on **_my
computer_**, that **_only_** I **_have access_** to the `.gnupg` folder. **_So
first_** I **_ran_** the **_following command_**:

```shell
chmod 700 ~/.gnupg
```

`chmod` is used to **_change_** the `permissions` of `files` and `directories`.
The **_above changes_** the `permissions` on the `.gnupg` folder to `700`. And
`700` **_means_** that **_only_** the `creator` and `owner` of the `folder`
**_can_** `Read`, `Write`, and `Execute` on the directory. And `group` and
`others` **_cannot perform_** any operation on the `files` in the `directory`.

**_Then_** I **_ran_** the **_following_**:

```shell
chmod 600 ~/.gnupg/*
```

**_Here_**, the `permissions` for the `files` **_inside_** the `.gnupg` folder
are **_set to_** `600`. This **_means_** the `owner` has `Read` and `Write`
permissions on the `files` **_but not_** `execution` permissions.

**_Lastly_**, I **_ran_** the **_following_**:

```shell
chmod 700 ~/.gnupg/*.d
```

**_This is_** an `extra` and `special command` **_which is_** what **_made_** it
**_possible_** for me to **_change_** the `permissions` on the `.gnupg` folder
and `contents` to the **_proper settings_**. **_Inside_** the `folder`, **_there
is_** a `directory` which **_by default_** does **_not have_**
`execution permissions` when one **_tries_** to `send keys` **_without_** a
`keyserver` specified:

```shell
drw-------  2 rik rik  4096 Jun  9 03:28 crls.d    <---- Notice this here
```

So `*.d` **_ensures that_** all `.d` directories **_inside_** have
`execution permissions`. **_To view_** the `source` **_where_** I **_got_** this
`information` **_from_** on `Github`, **_please visit_**
[This fixes the " gpg: WARNING: unsafe permissions on homedir '/home/path/to/user/.gnupg' " error while using Gnupg.](https://gist.github.com/oseme-techguy/bae2e309c084d93b75a9b25f49718f85),
and scroll down to kirvedx's comment from Jun 13, 2022.

## Decrypting files with GnuPG

**_Next_**, I **_ran_** the **_following command_** to `decrypt` the
`greetings.txt.gpg` file I **_just_** had **_encrypted_**:

```shell
gpg --batch --output greetings1.txt --passphrase mypassword --decrypt greetings.txt.gpg
```

**_And_** the **_following_** was **_returned_** in `Terminal`:

```shell
gpg: AES256 encrypted data
gpg: encrypted with 1 passphrase
```

**_Then_**, to **_clear_** the `passphrase` which was **_stored_** in the
**_session_**, I **_ran_** the **_following command_**:

```shell
echo RELOADAGENT | gpg-connect-agent
```

**_Next_**, I **_wanted_** to **_verify_** that my `decrypted` file `matched` my
**_original_** `greetings.txt` file, so I **_ran_** the **_following command_**:

```shell
diff -s greetings.txt greetings1.txt
```

**_And_** the **_following_** was **_returned_** in `Terminal`:

```shell
Files greetings.txt and greetings1.txt are identical
```

Success!

**Note**: the `-s` option is short for `--sign`, which stands for "sign a
message". So basically, I am checking to make sure that the integrity of the
file when decrypted was intact.
