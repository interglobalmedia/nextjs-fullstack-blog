In my **_previous_** **podcast** entitled
[Using VS Code's REST Client extension instead of Postman](/blog/using-vs-codes-rest-client-extension-instead-of-postman/),
I **discussed** using a `GET` **request** with **VS Code's** `REST Client`
**extension** in a `production` **environment**. **_Now_** I will **discuss**
using a `POST` **request** in a `local` **environment**.

**_First_** I had to **add** the **following** to my `rest-client.rest` **file** (I **found out** that if I **added** the `.rest` **extension**, it would **recognize** the `http` **language** by **_default_**):

```http
@hostname = localhost
@port = 3000
@host = {{hostname}}:{{port}}
@contentType = application/json

# POST /users
POST http://{{host}}/users HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: {{contentType}}

{
    "name": "Michael",
    "email": "michael@michael.com",
    "age": 23,
    "password": "1234567"
}
```

This `code` **differs** from the **_previous_** `request` **code** in a
**couple** of **ways**. **_First_** of **all**, it is a `POST` **request**
instead of a `GET` **request**. **_Second_** of **all**, the **environment** is `local`. And **_third_** of **all**, I am **using** `environment` **variables** here.

And **this** is **what** I **had** in my `index.js` (my **Express** `server`
**file**):

```js
const express = require('express')
const app = express()
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000
require('./db/mongoose')
const User = require('./models/user')

/*
express will automatically parse incoming json
to an object so we can access it in our request handlers
We can do that using req.body
*/
app.use(express.json())

app.post('/users', (req, res) => {
	const user = new User(req.body)
	user.save()
	    .then(() => {
		   res.send(user)
	    })
	    .catch(() => {})
	    })
})
app.listen(port, () => {
    console.log(`Server is running on Port ${port} ...`)
})
```

**When** I **clicked** on `"Send Request"` **located** **right above** `POST`,
The **_following_** was **returned** in the `Response`:

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
X-Powered-By: Express
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 119
ETag: W/"77-tTFyEkK9sxYeShiMfIo+M6HknHI"
Date: Wed, 09 Sep 2020 11:13:31 GMT
Connection: close

{
  "age": 23,
    "_id": "5f58b8dbc3c61a59129690ff",
  "name": "Michael",
  "email": "michael@michael.com",
  "password": "1234567",
  "__v": 0
}
```

And the **_following_** was **returned** in the `mongo` **shell**:

```js
{ "_id" : ObjectId("5f58b8dbc3c61a59129690ff"), "age" : 23, "name" : "Michael", "email" : "michael@michael.com", "password" : "1234567", "__v" : 0 }
```

And **_that_** is **it**! **Well**, you **get** the **idea**.

Just **make** **_sure_** that the `server` is **running**. **Sometimes** you may **_think_** that it **is** because you are **sure** you **_started_** **running it** a **little while** **_before_**, but for **whatever reason**, you might **end up** getting inadvertently **disconnected** (or **_perhaps_** you **disconnected** the `server` and **forgot**!). It is **_important_** to
**check** whether the `server` is **running** **_before_** `clicking` on
`Send Request`.

In **order** to **_make sure_** you are actually **connected** to the `server`
via the `REST Client`, **make sure** that `"port"` has been **selected** with
`rest-client.rest`. It **_should_** **look** something like **this**:

***Screenshot of REST Client VS Code extension local environment POST request***

The **reason** **_why_** this is **possible** is because I **created** some
`environment` **variables** **_including_** for the `port`. And **_that's_**
**what** **_makes_** it **possible** for me to **connect** via `localhost` while the `server` is **running** on the **_same_** `port` as I **define** in my `rest-client.rest` **file**.

And **_that_** is **it**!
