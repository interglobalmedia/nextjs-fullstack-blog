In this series, I follow the official Django Polls application tutorial. After
refactoring an application which had been created over seven years ago, I
thought the best way to become even more familiar with the Django documentation
would be to follow their Django Polls tutorial and create a Django Polls
application.

## Series Table of Contents

1. [Creating the official Django Polls app Part 1](/blog/creating-the-official-django-polls-app-part-1):
   In this section, I create a directory to house my Django Polls application,
   check if I have Django installed, select my Python interpreter, install
   virtualenv with pip, create a virtual environment for Django Polls, activate
   and deactivate the virtual environment, install Django, upgrade Django,
   create a project in Django Polls, initialize git, start up the Django
   development server, create an app called polls, write a first view, create a
   URLconf for the index view, and configure the global URL configuration.
1. [Creating the official Django Polls app Part 2](/blog/creating-the-official-django-polls-app-part-2):
   In this section, I set up the Django Polls database, explained/set
   LANGUAGE_CODE, USE_I18N, USE_THOUSAND_SEPARATOR, NUMBER_GROUPING, USE_TZ, and
   INSTALLED_APPS, created the polls models, activated the models, played with
   the API in the interactive Python shell, discussed the Django admin
   interface, created a superuser, started the development server, registered
   polls app in polls/admin.py, and discussed the Question form in the admin
   interface.
1. [Creating the official Django Polls app Part 3](/blog/creating-the-official-django-polls-app-part-3):
   In this section, we write our first Django app, discuss URL patterns, write
   more views in polls/views.py, write views that actually work, re-write the
   index view, create a templates directory in the polls directory, implement
   template namespacing, add Django code to index.html, update the index view to
   use the new index.html template, implement the render() shortcut, implement
   raising a 404 error in the detail view, use get_object_or_404() in the detail
   view, discuss Model's manager in Django, discuss Manager names, use template
   tags in the template engining system, remove the hardcoded URL in the
   template in polls/index.html, and namespace our URL names.
1. [Creating the official Django Polls app Part 4](/blog/creating-the-official-django-polls-app-part-4):
   In this section, we add a minimal form to our polls.detail.html template, we
   update the function based vote view, create a polls/results.html template,
   refactor our polls/urls.py to match the new generic views, and we install
   DJLint to format our Django templates.
1. [Creating the official Django Polls app Part 5](/blog/creating-the-official-django-polls-app-part-5#creating-more-comprehensive-tests-for-questionrecently-published):
   In this section, we are introduced to automated testing. We discuss what
   automated testing is, why it's important to create tests, basic testing
   strategies, write our first test to identify a bug, fix the bug, create more
   comprehensive tests for Question.recently_published(), test a view, analyze
   the tools available to us in testing, are introduced to the Django test
   client, improve our PollsIndexView, test our new PollsIndexView, test the
   PollsDetailView, and break down the refactored PollsDetailView (which
   originally contained a bug which I fixed).
1. [Creating the official Django Polls app Part 6](/blog/creating-the-official-django-polls-app-part-6):
   In this section, we add static files to our Django Polls application
   configured for development.
