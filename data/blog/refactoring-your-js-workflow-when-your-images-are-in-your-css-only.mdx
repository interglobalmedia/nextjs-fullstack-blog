***Quote about big code refactoring***

I have been doing ***quite*** a ***bit*** of ***enhancing*** and ***refactoring*** of `apps` I ***have built*** lately. I have ***also*** been ***tossing*** `one` or `two` ***here*** and ***there*** because the `APIs` they ***relied*** on were ***retired***. A ***good excuse*** to ***re-build*** them ***differently***! I ***refactored*** `one app` I ***love*** `yesterday`, and it ***proved*** to ***be*** a ***bit*** of a ***challenge***. Something a ***bit different*** for me in a ***purely*** `Webpack workflow`.

My `images` for my `CSS slider` were ***only embedded*** in my `CSS`, ***not*** in my `HTML`. When I ***had created*** this ***2 years ago***, I ***really liked*** the ***effect*** and ***feel***, and ***decided*** to ***take*** `that route` ***instead*** of `JS`. It ***also involved*** `animation`, which I
***really like*** `working with` ***as well***.

The `workflow` which was ***attached*** to the `app` is now ***obsolete***, so I ***decided*** to ***adapt*** my ***latest*** `React workflow` ***using*** `Webpack 4`, `Babel 7`, `ESLint`, `Prettier`, etc., to ***this application***. I ***thought*** it ***should*** be a ***seamless transition***, as I had ***already adapted*** the `workflow` to ***another*** `JS app` I ***had completed*** `recently`, and it
***works beautifully***.

I ***refactored*** the `workflow` and ***ran*** the `app` ***locally***, and ***everything worked*** as ***expected***. Then I ***ran*** my ***first*** `build`. `Webpack` ***could not find*** `my images`! `Surprise surprise`. This was ***also*** a ***bit*** of a ***challenge*** when I ***used*** my `Gulp/Webpack workflow` ***on*** the `app` ***2 years ago***. It ***all had*** to ***do*** with the `path` to the `images` ***relative*** to ***where*** the `CSS file` ***resided***.

***When*** your `images` are ***embedded*** in your `HTML` or your `JS/JSX`, there is ***no problem***. `Webpack` figures out ***where*** your `image` is, ***whether*** it is in your `static folder` or in an `images folder` in your `src`. In the ***case*** of `React`, ***at least*** `for me`, in the `root` of the `app`. But ***this time***, ***neither was*** the ***case***. This is ***how*** my `app` was ***structured*** when I ***ran*** my ***first*** `build`:

```markdown
-config

-   webpack.base.config.js
-   webpack.prod.config.js
-   src
    -   audio
    -   images
    -   modules
        -   catStoryText.js
        -   textToSpeech.js
        -   styles
            -   base
            -   modules
            -   styles.css
            -   styles.css.map
            -   styles.scss
    -   favicon.ico
    -   index.html
    -   index.js
    -   sw.js
-   .eslintrc.json
-   .gitignore
-   .prettierrc.json
-   README.md
-   babel.config.js
-   package-lock.json
-   package.json
-   postcss.config.js
```

***When*** the `build` was ***created***, the `styles.css` ***resided within*** a `folder` ***called*** `styles` in `dist`, and the `images` ***resided*** in an `images folder` at the ***same level*** as the `styles folder`. But the `styles.css` was ***inside*** the `styles folder`, and the `images path` ***being rendered*** in `styles.css` was ***the following***:

```css
#blinds:after {
    background: transparent url(images/pattern.png) repeat top left;
}
```

***for example***. I ***sometimes had*** a ***similar issue*** when ***developing*** `workflows` for my `React projects` ***in which*** I was using ***both*** `CSS Modules` and `SCSS`. ***Not that*** I ***was*** necessarily ***embedding*** `images` ***only*** in `CSS` ***instead*** of ***inside*** my `React components`. I ***was not***. But I ***had*** to ***make*** the `path` to `styles.scss` ***work*** in the `React application` ***alongside*** the `CSS Modules`. So I ***moved*** `styles.scss` ***outside*** of the `styles folder` ***into*** the `root` of `src`.

In ***this case***, ***even though*** I ***was not*** entirely ***happy*** about ***removing*** a `styles folder` in `dist`, ***moving*** `styles.css` ***into*** the `root` of `src` ***allowed me*** to ***keep*** the ***original functionality*** of the `application`. One ***should not have*** to ***refactor*** the ***way*** one ***displays*** one’s `image slider` ***just for*** the ***sake of*** a `styles folder` in `dist`! ***As it is***, ***there*** is ***only one*** `styles bundle`, and ***more important***, I ***am able*** then to ***maintain*** my ***many images*** in an `images folder` and my ***scripts*** in a `scripts folder` ***as well***!

My `audio file` ***on*** the ***other hand***, ***did not pose*** an ***issue***. It was ***being called*** into ***my*** `JS`, and the `path` ***relative*** to the `JS` ***did not change***. ***However***, its `functionality` ***did rely*** on the ***presence*** of `images`, so it ***did not work*** `until` the
***images*** were `‘found’` by `Webpack`.

**_Takeaway?_** The `workflow` with ***pure*** `Webpack` is ***much terser*** and ***therefore drier*** in ***my opinion*** than a `Gulp/Webpack workflow`. `Gulp` just adds ***too many layers*** and ***files*** to the ***mix***. ***In addition***, ***many*** of the ***tools*** I ***used*** with it ***are not*** being ***well maintained*** now, ***especially related*** to `image compression`!

***Once*** you ***wrap*** your ***head around*** `Webpack`, it ***really*** is a ***great bundler*** and ***appropriate*** for ***so many different*** `use cases`!

If you are ***interested*** in ***seeing*** the `difference between` the ***old version*** of the `workflow` and the ***new version***, just ***go back*** to ***earlier commits*** in the `repo code`!
