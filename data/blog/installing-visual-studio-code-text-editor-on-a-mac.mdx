I ***resisted switching*** to `Microsoft`‘s `Visual Studio Code` for ***quite*** a
***while***. ***Partly because*** I ***didn’t want*** to ***pay*** for ***yet another*** `text editor`. I had ***already paid*** for `Sublime Text` to ***upgrade*** to `V3` and get ***full benefits***. I ended up ***not liking*** it ***anyway***! ***Then*** I had `WebStorm` which I got ***because*** I **_already had_** `PHP Storm` and ***liked it*** for `WordPress development`. ***Paid*** for that
***too***. I **_mainly_** ended up **_working with_** the ***free*** text editor
`Atom`, ***however***. I **_loved it_** because of its `UI` and `integration` with
`Git`. And the `Github` team ***created it***, so that ***made*** it even ***more appealing***. I have been **_deploying_** virtually ***all*** my ***local*** `repos` to
`Github`, so ***using*** `Atom` just ***made sense*** to ***me***.

***But*** I ***found*** that `Atom` was **_becoming_** VERY SLOW. The ***bigger*** my `projects` ***got***, the ***slower*** it ***became***. Then I ***also noticed*** that ***sometimes*** when I ***switched*** `branches`, ***on switching***, ***some*** `files` ***did not*** `close`. They would ***remain open*** and ***unsaved*** when ***switching back*** to `master`. It ***got confusing*** and ***potentially dangerous***, ***because*** I would ***not know*** what ***was*** what. But this had ***never happened*** before. ***Probably*** I ***had upgraded*** `Atom`, and the `setting` ***related*** to ***this issue*** had ***gone away***. That is ***another thing*** that I ***did not*** like ***about*** `Atom`. When one
***upgraded*** to the ***latest version***, ***certain***, but not all, `settings` would ***revert*** to `default`. I ***subsequently*** found out that there is a `setting` ***called*** `Close File Deleted Tabs` in `Core Settings` that ***makes sure*** that `deleted files` **_actually close_**. ***That helped***. But in ***my case*** what was ***also happening***, was that ***certain*** `changes` ***didn’t*** ***seem*** to ***transfer*** over `locally` on a `git merge` ***even though*** they `showed up` ***remotely***! That’s ***because*** `Atom` was ***becoming*** SO SLOW. SO I ***knew*** that ***at least*** for ***bigger projects***, I ***would have*** to
***start using*** something else.

`Webstorm` ***does not*** have the **_greatest_** `UI`. It ***also*** does ***not have*** the ***greatest assortment*** of `plugins`. ***But***, it is ***really great*** for ***remote deployment***, ***especially*** to `hosting services`. **_Connecting with_** `FTPs` is a **_snap_** (***note 02.08.2023***: ***now*** I ***use*** `Cyberduck` for ***SFTP***) and `things` ***like that***. So I will ***definitely continue*** to ***use*** it for ***specific purposes***. But I ***had*** to ***find something*** that would ***improve upon*** my ***daily development*** `text editor` ***experience***. ***In desperation***, I ***decided*** to ***check out***
`Microsoft`‘s `Visual Studio Code`. To ***my amazement***, I ***found*** that the
`editor` ***itself*** is `100%` ***FREE***! I had been ***under*** the ***impression*** that I ***had*** to ***pay*** for it. But ***that*** is ***not*** the ***case***. So I ***immediately downloaded*** it and ***installed*** it. I am ***writing*** this `blog post` with it ***right now***.

`Visual Studio Code` is ***available*** now for `Mac`. I ***know*** that in the ***past*** it ***was not***. There is ***great documentation*** to ***get*** you ***started*** on a `Mac`. You ***can also*** `sign up` for `Visual Studio Dev Essentials`. ***However***, if you **_already subscribe_** to a `Microsoft` ***product***, i.e., `Office 365` (***I do***), ***all*** you ***have*** to ***do*** is ***sign in*** with ***those credentials***.

To ***download*** `Visual Studio Code`, ***go*** [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/). To ***learn more*** about ***running*** `VS Code` on a `Mac`, ***please visit***

*Have fun coding with* `Visual Studio Code`!
