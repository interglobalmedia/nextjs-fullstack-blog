***Tonight*** I **gave** my **_first tech presentation_** (ever), and it was about ***creating*** your own **React workflow** **_without using_** `create-react-app`. I was ***nervous*** `at first`, but then after a minute or two, I
***relaxed*** and ***rode*** with it. ***17 minutes*** into it, I was ***signaled*** that I only had `5 minutes` ***left***, and I ***still had*** `11 minutes` ***to go***. I had ***timed*** it ***quite*** a ***few times***, and ***brought*** it ***down*** to `28 minutes`. ***Yikes***! ***Well***, I was as ***cool*** as a
***cucumber*** and ***skipped part*** of it to ***move onto*** the `section` on ***configuring*** `POSTCSS` and ***then onto*** **_configuring_** **Jest** **_for_** **React** after
that. ***Luckily***, I*** wrote*** the `presentation` in ***such*** a ***way*** that ***even though*** I `might have` ***skipped over*** a ***part*** of it, people ***still*** could ***refer*** to the ***whole thing*** `online` ***without missing*** out on ***anything***.

I ***know*** that to ***most developers***, ***talking*** about ***creating*** their **_own_** `React workflow` **_from scratch_** `without` the ***help*** of `create-react-app`, and
**_dissecting_** `each step` might ***not be*** at all **_“sexy”_**. ***However***, I felt ***very strongly*** about ***presenting*** it. I ***know*** from my ***own experience*** that ***developing*** a ***good*** `automated workflow` is ***hard***, and ***takes*** a ***long time*** to `master` and `refine`. It is ***also*** the ***area*** that `developers` ***don’t want*** to ***spend*** too ***much time*** on to
***understand*** what is `under` the `hood`. We ***search*** for **_quick_** `boiler plates` or `completed workflows` we can ***copy*** from ***without*** really ***understanding*** `why`
and `how` it ***works***. `Workflow` **_deep dives_** mean `taking time` away `from` **_learning sexy_** `JS`, `JSX`, `React`, or the **_latest_** in `GraphQL` or `Apollo`. But ***these workflows*** save us **_so much time_** in the ***long run***. `Understanding` **_how_** and **_why_** these `automations` **_work_** also ***permits us*** to **_expand_** our `developer tool kits` and `horizons`.

I ***felt*** it ***important*** to ***share*** some of the `webpack fundamentals` **_related to_** `React` that I ***amassed*** over time `with others` so that they ***could open*** their ***eyes*** to the `possibilities` ***available*** to ***them***. And I am ***very grateful*** to the
`ReactNYC` **_team_** for ***giving me*** the `opportunit`y to ***present*** `tonight`!
