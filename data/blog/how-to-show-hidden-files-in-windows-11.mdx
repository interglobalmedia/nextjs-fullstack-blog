## So what is a hidden file anyway?

Sometimes we have to make changes to files whose names begin with a dot (`.`),
but dot files are hidden, and we can't see them!

In this article, I will discuss how we can show hidden files in Windows 11. And
for those of you that are familiar with Windows 10, showing hidden files in
Windows 11 is much more straightforward, and the process is different.

## Showing hidden files via the File Explorer

In order to show hidden files in File Explorer, first I launch File Explorer via
the search bar in the Windows dock and type "File Explorer". Then I click on
"File Explorer" to go into it and find the location of the hidden files (or
folders) I want to reveal:

In this case, I have selected a folder called "development" on the Desktop, and
it looks something like the following:

![development folder selected in File Explorer](Screenshot-2024-07-10-175551.png)

I click on the View tab in the File Explorer menu bar, and the following
appears:

Next, I go down to the Show option at the bottom and select it. The following
appears:

As shown in the screenshot, I select "Hidden Items", which then results in the
appearance of a dot folder called `.git`.

When I deselect "Hidden Items", `.git` disappears.

## Showing hidden files via Command Prompt

If are like me, and you like working via Command Line (Command Prompt) as much
as possible, you can go to the same search bar in the Windows dock and type the
following:

```shell
cmd
```

Then I click on Command Prompt in the search results, and something like the
following appears:

![Command Prompt window](Screenshot-2024-07-10-190019.png)

**_Command Prompt window_**

Next, I `cd` into the folder where I want to reveal hidden files or folders:

![cd into folder where to reveal hidden files or folders](Screenshot-2024-07-10-190446.png)

Then I run the `dir` command to see what is visible in the folder:

![running the dir command in Command Prompt](Screenshot-2024-07-10-190519.png)

**_Running the `dir` command in Command Prompt_**

No dot (hidden) commands are visible. They are not by default.

Next I run the following command in Command Prompt:

```shell
dir /a:h
```

which results in the following:

![running the dir /a:h command in Command processrompt](Screenshot-2024-07-10-190614.png)

**_Running the `dir /a:h` command in Command Prompt_**

Now a dot folder called `.git` appears. However, when I run the `dir` command
again, the .git folder is hidden again, because the result of `dir /a:h` is not
persistent.
