`JavaScript` powers the web - it's the ***most important*** `programming language` you ***need*** to ***know*** as a `web developer`.

***For example***, you should understand code like this:

```javascript
const basics = 'Okay, that should not be too difficult actually';

function printBasics() {
  console.log(basics):
}

printBasics();
```
