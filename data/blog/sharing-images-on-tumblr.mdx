*Created By [Night Cafe Creator](https://creator.nightcafe.studio/)*

Yesterday, I shared my first link post, AND I shared my first image post on Tumblr. I had just generated an Artifical Intelligence (AI) image using a service called [Night Cafe Creator](https://creator.nightcafe.studio/), and they generate images in webp format by default. Twitter accepts images in webp format, but Tumblr does not. Neither does Linkedin, *BTW*. But I remembered that I could simply ***transform*** my `webp` ***image*** into a `jpeg` (`jpg`) ***image*** using my `macOS Finder`. To ***learn*** how to ***do this***, please ***visit*** my `article` ***entitled*** [Converting image formats on macOS using the Finder app](https://www.interglobalmedianetwork.com/blog/converting-image-formats-on-macos-using-the-finder-app) on my business site [interglobalmedianetwork.com](https://www.interglobalmedianetwork.com).

So when you ***share*** an `image` on `Tumblr`, ***make sure*** that you have a `copy` of it in `jpeg` (`jpg`) ***format***, and ***keep*** it ***handy*** for those `Linkedin` ***posts*** that you may ***want*** to ***create*** with it. `Twitter`, on the other hand, ***accepts*** the `webp` ***format***.

*Happy tumblring!*
