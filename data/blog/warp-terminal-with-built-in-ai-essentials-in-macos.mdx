## A bit of background history to this article

I just started writing an article about Vim. Its features, shortcuts, how to get
around. I have been basically doing everything inside Vim in my Linux Mint OS in
VirtualBox, installed in Windows 11. So i thought it would be great to write an
article about why it is such a great text editor (and it is). But then I
serendipitously cam across an article about Warp, and it got me curious. Well,
the rest is history!

So here I am going to integrate Vim features and essentials with the Warp
experience, because Vim works in Warp as well. I wil also write a separate
article dedicated just to VIm.

## Meet Warp, the modern Terminal with AI built-in

Warp is an amazing modern Terminal with AI built-in. I just learned about it
NOW, and was totally hooked from the get-go. Once I started using it and
learning a bit more about it, I don't know why I would want to use a traditional
Terminal program such as iTerm (macOS) or Terminal (macOS or Windows 11). If
possible of course. The only thing I have to figure out now is how to make it
work in my Linux Mint OS in VirtualBox. Apparently it is available for Windows,
so no brainer there!
