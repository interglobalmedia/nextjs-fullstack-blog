## What is Steganography and how does it compare to Cryptography?

Steganography is a method in which secret messages are hidden in cover media.
Cover media refers to any unsuspicious file, such as a nature photo, family
photo, audio, video clip, etc. And steganography means "covered writing".

> Content concealed through steganography is sometimes encrypted before being
> hidden within another file format. If it isn't encrypted, then it may be

Steganography is sometimes compared to cryptography, because both are a form of
covert communication. However, the two are NOT the same. Steganography does not
involve scrambling data upon sending or using a key to decode it upon receipt.
As a result, steganography is less popular than cryptography, because the
structure of data is not altered by default. Forms of steganography are:

-   Text
-   Audio
-   Video
-   Images
-   Network or Protocol

## What is Cryptography and how does it compare to Steganography?

Cryptography is the process of hiding or coding information so that only the
person the message was intended for can read it. Modern cryptography techniques
include algorithms and ciphers that enable the encryption and decryption of
information, such as 128-bit and 256-bit encryption keys. Modern ciphers, such
as the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), are considered virtually unbreakable.
To learn more about encrypting and decrypting files, please visit my post
entitled
[Encrypting/Decrypting Files and Strings](https://github.com/interglobalmedia/encrypt-decrypt-files-python)
on Github.

According to
[Fortnet](https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/what-is-cryptography),

> Cryptography remains important to protecting data and users, ensuring
> confidentiality, and preventing cyber criminals from intercepting sensitive
> corporate information.

## So what is Image Steganography in Cryptography?

According to
[Geeks For Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/image-steganography-in-cryptography/),

> As the name suggests, Image Steganography refers to the process of hiding data
> within an image file. The image selected for this purpose is called the cover
> image and the image obtained after steganography is called the stego image.

Steganography in of itself is "security by obscurity". This means that the
secret message embedded in the image could end up being "uncovered". But
combining Cryptography and Steganography is a robust way to disguise a message
from adversaries while still protecting it in case of detection.

One way of implementing a cryptographic algorithm approach is concealing a
[large amount of data](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/image-steganography-in-cryptography/)
within a color bitmap (bmp) image. The image is filtered and segmented, with
bits replacement applied to the appropriate pixels. These pixels are chosen at
random.

Detection of the message within the cover image is done by the process of
steganalysis. And what is steganalysis? According to Mayuri Bhamare in his
Linkedin post entitled
[What is Steganalysis?](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-steganalysis-mayuri-bhamare/),

> Steganalysis is the study of detecting messages hidden using steganography;
> this is analogous to cryptanalysis applied to cryptography. Steganalysis
> refers to detection of the presence of hidden information in the stego-object.

I actually built an image steganography project implementing the above described
bitmap approach using PIL (Python Imaging Library). When I decrpyted the
encrypted hidden text message inside an image, I got totally incomprehensible
data output in Terminal. I also could not view the complete output, because it
was too large for viewing in a Terminal window instance. I created a CLI command
that would redirect the data into a text file that I could open and examine
after running the command. The following is the command that I cerated to do
this:

```shell
python3 cryptography-steganography.py >> output_text.txt
```

This way, I could examine the complete output resulting from the executing of my
`cryptography-steganography.py` file. Totally impossible to decipher. However, I
found that using a jpg image is not good, because it is a lossy file format,
which means that information is lost in processes.

Screenshot of executing
`python 3 cryptography-steganography.py >> output_text.txt` before changing my
jpg file to a png file:

![jpg output text screenshot](output_text_jpg_screenshot.jpg)

_Output text screenshot in jpg format_

To change the file format of an image on macOS via the CLI, I ran the following
command:

```shell
sips -s format png geranimo-bKhETeDV1WM-unsplash.jpg --output geranimo-bKhETeDV1WM-unsplash.png
```

For those of you that may not know what the sips command, it comes built in with
macOS. `sips` stands for `Scriptable image processing system`, and it is:

> used to query or modify raster image files (JPG/GIF/PNG) and ColorSync ICC
> profiles. Image processing options include flip, rotate, change image
> format/width/height. Its functionality can also be used through the "Image
> Events" AppleScript suite.

When I changed it to png format, and then ran the following command again:

```shell
python3 cryptography-steganography.py >> output_text.txt
```

The hidden text does appear the top of the txt file, followed by the bitmap
information of the image.

## Applying image steganography with the steghide via Kali Linux

In order to use the `steghide package` which is a command line tool, I had to
install and use it via `Kali Linux`. I am on macOS and therefore not a Linux
computer, so installing `steghide` directly onto my `macOS` was not possible.

First, I created two folders for my project so that I could have everything well
organized on my `Kali Desktop`. One I called `file_embed`, and the other I
called `file_extract`. So:

```shell
mkdir file_embed file_extract
```

Which resulted in:

```shell
file_embed
file_extract
test.txt
```

Next, I moved the `test.txt` file and the `jpg image` I had downloaded from
`pexels.com` via `Firefox-ESR` in `Kali Linux` into the `file_embed` folder.

I looked for the image download via Terminal so that I could get the path to it:

```shell
find -name "pexels-brian-machado-10626267.jpg"
```

Which returned:

```shell
./Downloads/pexels-brian-machado-10626267.jpg
```

I moved the image from the `Downloads folder` to the `Desktop folder`:

```shell
mv ./Downloads/pexels-brian-machado-10626267.jpg ~/Desktop
```

Next, I moved the image from the `Desktop` into the `file_embed` folder located
on the `Desktop`. So:

```shell
mv pexels-brian-machado-10626267.jpg file_embed
```

And then I moved the `test.txt` file into the `file_embed` folder as well:

```shell
mv test.txt file_embed
```

Then I checked to make sure that I had successfully moved the two files into
`file_embed`:

```shell
ls file_embed
```

Which returned the following:

```shell
pexels-brian-machado-10626267.jpg  test.txt
```

Now I was ready to conduct some `steganography` with `steghide` in `Kali Linux`!

To `embed` the `test.txt` file into the `jpg image`, I used the following
command:

```shell
steghide embed -ef file_embed/test.txt -cf file_embed/pexels-brian-machado-10626267.jpg
```

The `-ef` option stands for `embed file`, and the `-cf` option stands for
`copy file`. So the command states that the `test.txt` file was the file to be
`embedded` by `copying` it `into` the `jpg image`.

And the following was initially returned:

```shell
Enter passphrase:
Re-Enter passphrase:
```

So I entered a passphrase of my choosing and hit return after inputting it the
second time, and the following was returned in Terminal:

```shell
embedding "file_embed/test.txt" in "file_embed/pexels-brian-machadoembedding "file_embed/test.txt" in "file_embed/pexels-brian-machado-10626267.jpg"... done
```

The result of executing this command wass the integration of the `test.txt` file
into my `jpg image` I downloaded from `pexels.com`.

Next, I had to `extract` `test.txt` from the j`pg image`, but I wanted to
extract the file into the `file_extract` folder. I `changed directories` (cd)
into the empty `file_extract` folder from `Desktop`:

```shell
cd file_extract
```

Then, from there, I ran the following command to `extract` the `test.txt` file
from the `jpg image`:

```shell
steghide extract -sf ../file_embed/pexels-brian-machado-10626267.jpg
```

The `-sf` option followed by the (path to the) `filename` extracts in this case
the `test.txt` file from the jpg image.

I had to add two dots before the slash in order to step out of the
`file_extract` folder and into the `Desktop` in order to be able to access the
`file_embed` folder there.

Next, I ran the `ls file_extract` command from `Desktop` and the following was
returned:

```shell
test.txt
```

Success! I kept my original `test.txt` file inside the `file_embed` folder, and
then extracted it from inside the `file_extract` folder. And THEN, I could
compare the two files to make sure that they actually are the same using the
`sha-256 standard`.

## Checking for file integrity

Let's say I wanted to check and make sure that no changes had been made to my
"confidential" `test.txt` file in the `embed/extract` process. Or let's say that
I had embedded the `test.txt` file in my `jpg image` and that hypothetically I
had sent it to someone else to extract the `test.txt` file`, and they wanted to
make sure that the file had not experienced any modifications or corruption in
transit.

I already had the [SHA-256 standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2)
installed in my `Kali Linux OS` on my `macOS` via the `UTM` virtual machine, so
I was able do the following to `check` the `integrity` of both my `test.txt`
files located in the `file_embed` and `file_extract` folders.

First, I created a `sha-256 hash digest` (`hash value`) for the `test.txt` file
inside `file_embed` using the following command:

```shell
sha256sum file_embed/test.txt
```

And the following was returned:

```shell
6f6739d1e1439a493c82c506e4175739ac47a32418a122cf141fda7fe740ca17  file_embed/test.txt
```

I could also `redirect` the `hash digest` to a file, and then do the same for
the `test.txt` file inside the `file_extract` folder. So first:

```shell
sha256sum file_embed/test.txt > checksum
```

Above, the single `>` greater than angle bracket which is a `redirect operator`
in Command Line, `redirects` the `output` of a `command`. Here, it `redirects`
the `output` of the `sha256sum` command to a file called `checksum` which it
also creates, because one did not previously exist.

And when I run the `cat checksum` command:

```shell
cat checksum
```

The following was returned:

```shell
6f6739d1e1439a493c82c506e4175739ac47a32418a122cf141fda7fe740ca17  file_embed/test.txt
```

Next, I did the same for the `test.txt` file inside the `file_extract` folder.
So first:

```shell
sha256sum file_extract/test.txt >> checksum
```

This time, I used the double `>>` greater than angle bracket to append the
output of the `sha256sum` command to the contents of the checksum file. If I had
used the single angle bracket, the existing contents of the file would have been
overwritten by the `current output redirection`.

Next, I ran the `cat` command on `checksum` again to view what has been added to
the `checksum` file:

```shell
cat checksum
```

And the following was returned:

```shell
6f6739d1e1439a493c82c506e4175739ac47a32418a122cf141fda7fe740ca17  file_embed/test.txt
6f6739d1e1439a493c82c506e4175739ac47a32418a122cf141fda7fe740ca17  file_extract/test.txt
```

The output of the second `sha256sum` command was `redirected` to the `checksum`
file and appended to existing contents of the file.

Next, I wanted to make sure that both files were the same, so I ran the
following command on `checksum`:

```shell
sha256sum --check checksum
```

And the following was returned:

```shell
file_embed/test.txt: OK
file_extract/test.txt: OK
```

Both files `passed` the `integrity test`.

If I had subsequently made a change to one of the files, "FAILED" would have
appeared instead of "OK".

So this is how we can conduct `integrity checks` on `files` in (`Kali`) `Linux`
that have undergone some sort of process or transmission, or simply have been in
storage for a long time, to make sure that they had not been corrupted or
modified.

## Conclusion

So why would one choose steganography over cryptography, or vice versa?
Steganography conceals data within data, and

Cryptography, on the other hand, changes data to ciphertext which can only be
"deciphered" or understood with a decryption key. And it is popular because it
scrambles the data. Steganography, on the other hand, by default, does not. And
it does not require a key. A passphrase is commonly used, like with `steghide`.

The main difference between Cryptography and Steganography is that Cryptography
protects the contents of data or messages, and Steganography hides the contents.
Even though both can be used for good, Steganography is easier and commonly used
by cyber threat actors.

According to the article entitled
[Steganography explained and how to protect against it](https://www.csoonline.com/article/571265/steganography-explained-and-how-to-protect-against-it.html)
by Andrada Fiscutean on CSO Online,

Cryptography can ensure the confidentiality, and integrity of data, but
Steganography violates the integrity of the host file in which the data is
hiddeen. It also violates
[Kerchkoff's (2nd) principle of Cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerckhoffs%27s_principle#Explanation_of_the_principle),
which states,

> It should not require secrecy, and it should not be a problem if it falls into
> enemy hands;

Some of his original principles are no longer relevant, but this second one is
still extremely important.

Bottom line? `Cryptography` over `Steganography`. And watch out for combinations
of `Cryptography` AND `Steganography`.

I will be following up this post with another which will focus on how one CAN
detect **stego-images**. I recently was apprised of a tool that does just that.
Stay tuned!
