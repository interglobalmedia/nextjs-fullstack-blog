Ever since I upgraded to **OSX Mojave,** a very strange thing would take place in **VSCode**, at first every now and again, and then more and more frequently. When I would **type** **_non-alpha characters_**, the wrong character would render. At first closing the window and re-opening via **Terminal** would take care of the issue. Then the other day I **_updated_** to **OSX 10.14.5** from **10.14.4**, and almost immediately, when I typed a non-alpha character, the wrong one rendered. When I closed out and re-opened the project, the bug no longer went away.

To make sure that it was **_not_** a **VSCode** **_only_** related issue, I
opened the **_default_** **Mac** text editor **TextEdit** to see if the same
would happen there. And it did! So it was **_not_** a **VSCode** issue as I
initially thought, but a **_bug_** in the system.

I thought it over for a short while, and then inadvertently hovered over the
**language icon** in my **Macbook Pro**'s **_navigation menu_**. It was **set** to **_Croatian_** and _NOT_ **English**. I hadn't _TOUCHED_ **OSX Dictation** in like forever. How did it suddenly switch my language of choice on me? That would be the only way that this could happen. When **_using_** **Dictation**, you can **choose** from a **_large variety_** of **languages**, and then **Dictation** uses that alphabet when transcribing your voice dictation. This is the only way that I can access foreign alphabets via the keyboard, for lack of a better word. I have searched for software that will do it for me so that I don't have to
dictate if I don't want, but had no luck. Those days are over! Thank God then for **Apple Dictation**. Please don't ever go away!

So how I did I solve my problem? The minute I **_switched_** from the **Croatian flag icon** to the **_American flag icon_**, my typing resulted in the rendering of correct non-alpha characters and I could **_resume_** my **web development** in **VSCode**.

This (not so little) glitch probably resulted first from the **_initial
upgrade_** to **Mojave** and then the **_latest update_** to **10.14.5**. If you experience a similar situation, just remember that simply checking to see which language is running on your system and then selecting your language of choice should remedy the issue.
