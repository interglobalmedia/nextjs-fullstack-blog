_Chattr public and private realtime chat_

This application is a `refactoring` of my original Node.js Express `Socket.io`
app using the `EJS` (`Embedded JavaScript`) templating engine for the
`front end`. I finally got to replacing `EJS` with `React`. It is still being
hosted on Heroku, but has been structured in such a way that `only` one `script`
is `required` to run the application instead of `two`. `Heroku` no longer
provides a free tier, but the lowest cost per month is low enough for me. `$5`!
And that is also $1 less than the lowest cost for hosting applications on
`Digital Ocean`: `$6/month`. Much less hassle, and `Heroku` is compatible with
my new Apple M1 Max chip MacBook Pro!
