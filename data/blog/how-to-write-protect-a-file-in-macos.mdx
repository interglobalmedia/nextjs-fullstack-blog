Sometimes you want to make sure that important files are not removed via Command
Line when using the `rm` (`remove`) command, you want to make sure that these
important files are write protected.

I'm going to use one of my shell script files I have created and spoke about in
previous posts as an example. In general, I want to make sure that my shell
scripts cannot accidentally be removed anyway!

When a file is "write protected", that means that it is "unalterable". It cannot
be changed or deleted by any type of user, including the root (or superuser) in
the macOS UNIX operating system.

First I use the `chflags` (change flags) command follwed by the `schg` (set the
system immutable flag) flag. This sets the sets the system immutable flag type
to a file:

```shell
chflags schg hello.sh
```

However, if I run the above command as is, the following is returned in
Terminal:

```shell
chflags: hello.sh: Operation not permitted
```

That's because I have to run it as `superuser`. So I have to add sudo to the
beginning of the command like so:

```shell
sudo chflags schg hello.sh
```

And the following is returned:

```shell
Password:
```

And I have to input my user password.

Then, if I try and delete the hello.sh file with the comamnd `rm hello.sh`, the
following is returned in Terminal:

```shell
override rwx------ mariacam/staff schg for hello.sh?
```

If I do actually want to delete the file, I type `y` for `yes`, and if it was a
mistake and I don't want to delete it, I type `n` for `no`.

I can also run the following command without `sudo` (which stands for
`superuser do`):

```shell
chflags uchg hello.sh
```

`uchg` represents the `user immutable flag`. With the system immutable flag, the
superuser can remove whichever file across the whole computer system, no matter
who owns which file. With the `user immutable flag`, only the owner can delete
files which they own. Other users on the system cannot delete another
owner/user's files.

So if I run the `chflags uchg test.txt` command, followed by the `rm test.txt`
command, the following is returned in Terminal:

```shell
override rwx------ mariacam/staff uchg for test.txt?
```

Again, I can either type `y` for `yes` if I want to actually delete the file, or
`n` for `no` if I don't. This prompt gives me the opportunity to change my mind
before actually deleting the file. However, if I do type `y` to remove the file,
I get the following in Terminal:

```shell
rm: test.txt: Operation not permitted
```

This proves that the `test.txt` file is truly "write protected" or "immutable".

If I decide that I no longer want the test.txt file to be write protected, I can
"unprotect" the file and therefore delete it with the `rm` command. To achieve
this, I run the following command in Terminal:

```shell
chflags nouchg test.txt
```

And then if I run the following command:

```shell
ls -l test.txt
```

The following is returned in Terminal:

```shell
-rwx------  1 mariacam  staff  0 Jul  6 07:21 test.txt
```

And then if I run `rm test.txt` followed by the `ls` command inside the
macos-scripting folder, the following is returned:

```shell
concatenate.sh              play_album.sh
concatenate.txt             play_song.sh
download_install_firefox.sh wifi_reset.sh
hello.sh
```

The `test.txt` file is successfully removed. The same can be done with the
`schg` flag. Instead of `nouchg` I would use `noschg`. I simply have to put `no`
in front of either the `user immutable flag` (`uchg`) or the
`system immutable flag` (`schg`) to remove the file's write protection. `no`
clears the flag.

**Note**: The above commands work for both files and folders alike.
