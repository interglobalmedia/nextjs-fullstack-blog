**Note:** This `article` ***doesn’t*** go ***into depth*** about ***commands***, i.e. `rm`, `rm -r`, etc., It’s about **_options_**. To ***read more*** about those ***commands***, ***please visit*** [Master the command line: Deleting files and folders](https://www.macworld.com/article/2082021/master-the-command-line-deleting-files-and-folders.html),
***also included*** at the ***end*** of the `article`.

I ***just finished*** `watching` Wes Bos’ **_Command Line For Power Users_** `series`, and it was ***great***. It ***focused*** on `Z Shell`, ***which*** is ***what*** I ***use***, and I ***learned*** a ***lot***. It `opened` ***new*** `doors` for me ***regarding*** `Command Line for Mac`, and I ***got*** to ***know*** my `computer` ***even better***. But ***then*** I ***got*** to the ***last video*** about ***using*** the `rm` `command` in `CLI` or ***installing*** the `npm trash package`. This package ***allows*** you to ***move files*** to the `trash` ***instead*** of ***deleting them*** `forever`, as the `rm/ rm -r` `command` ***does***. `rm` ***removes files***, `rm -r` ***removes folders***.

I ***noticed*** that the ***most effective*** `way` to ***install*** it is `globally`. ***However***, I have `permission issues` when I ***try*** and ***install*** `globally` ***with*** `El Capitan`, and there is ***always*** a ***potential*** `issue` or `conflict` when ***updating anything*** that has been ***installed*** `globally`. ***That*** is ***why*** I ***only*** do `local installs` ***within*** `projects`
themselves. ***In order*** to ***use*** the `trash package` the ***way*** I ***would want*** to, I ***would have*** to ***do*** an `npm init` ***everywhere***. ***In order*** for it to ***work*** for ***me***, I ***would have*** to ***install*** `trash` as a `devDependency` in ***every folder*** I ***have created*** on my `computer` that ***contains files*** that I ***use***. ***Well***, `that` ***does not*** `work` for ***me***. Some folders ***don’t*** even ***have*** `workflows` that ***use*** `npm`.

***At first*** I ***was going*** to ***totally*** `“trash”` the ***idea*** of ***using*** the `plugin`, but ***then*** I ***decided*** that ***maybe*** it would ***be nice*** to ***use*** it in ***some projects*** that ***already use*** `npm`, and ***for those*** that ***don’t***, I ***could*** just ***continue deleting*** `files`
and `folders` ***via*** my `Atom` `text editor`. It’s ***just*** as ***easy*** to ***do***, and it ***never*** `deletes` ***anything*** `permanently`. It just ***provides*** the `move to trash` ***option***. ***Works well*** for my `code related` ***projects***!

***There*** is ***also*** `another solution`. If you ***still want*** to `delete` ***via*** the `Command Line` but you ***want*** to `“play it safe”`, there are `“safety net”` ***commands*** you can ***use*** that will ***ask*** you if you ***really want*** to `delete something` ***before*** it ***gets*** `deleted` ***forever***. There is an `article` I ***came across*** on `macworld` ***entitled*** [Master the command line: Deleting files and folders](https://www.macworld.com/article/2082021/master-the-command-line-deleting-files-and-folders.html) that ***could prove*** `useful`. ***For instance***, if you ***wanted*** to `delete` a `file`, and
***wanted*** to ***be asked*** if you ***wanted*** to `delete` the `file` ***before*** it was `deleted` ***forever***, you would ***type***

```shell
rm -i dummy-file.txt
```

***for example***, and when you ***hit*** `return` you ***receive***

```shell
remove dummy-file.txt?
```

and you ***could*** either ***type*** `yes` or `y` and ***hit*** `return`. ***This way***, you ***have*** a `chance` to ***think twice*** about it and thus ***change*** your ***mind***. If you ***do change*** your ***mind*** when ***asked***, you simply ***would type*** `no` or `n`. Then ***if*** you ***typed***

```shell
ls
```

to ***see*** if it was ***still there***, it ***would be***, ***because*** you ***didn’t type*** `yes` or `y`. And **_btw_**, the `-i` `flag` is ***short*** for `-interactive`.

There are a ***slew*** of `“safety net` `commands` ***out there***, and ***this*** `article` is a ***great place*** to ***start***. There is ***a lot*** of ***useful information*** that will ***make you*** an ***even better*** `CLI` ***power user***!
