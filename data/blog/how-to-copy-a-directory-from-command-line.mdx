In my ***last post*** I ***talked about*** `zipping` and `unzipping` a ***directory*** from the
`Command Line`. I ***also mentioned*** how you could ***ignore*** `directories` ***within*** the `root` ***directory*** you are ***zipping***. But ***sometimes*** you just ***might want*** to `copy` a ***directory*** that is ***in one*** `location` to ***another*** `location`, for ***whatever reason***.

***Today,*** ***for example***, I just ***completed*** a ***new*** `project` for which I ***need***
to ***upload*** the ***complete directory*** (***minus*** the `node modules` ***of course***). ***However***, I ***first want*** to `copy` the ***directory*** to ***my*** `desktop` to ***prevent*** any `potential disaster` ***taking place*** with the `directory` ***when*** I ***upload*** it ***from*** `Command Line`. ***This way*** I ***work indirectly*** with the `directory` (the `copy`) ***instead*** of ***directly*** (with the
`original`).

So ***below*** is the `command` I **_typed_** in **Terminal**:

```shell
cp -R ~/development/bulletin-board-app ~/desktop/
```

There are ***two things*** to ***keep*** in ***mind/remember*** when ***copying*** a `directory`:

-   That you ***actually have*** the `read access` for the `files` of the `directory` in ***question***.
    ***Typically***, one would at ***least have*** `read access` on one’s ***own*** `computer`. ***On another***, it is probably a ***good idea*** to ***check***.

-   ***Don’t forget*** to ***add*** the `/` at the ***end*** of the `location` (`target directory`)
    you are ***copying*** your `directory` to. ***Otherwise***, the `target directory` itself
    will be ***overwritten*** by the `contents`.

To ***check whether*** you have `read access` to `files` ***within*** a `directory` or to the
`directory` ***itself***, `change into` (`cd` into) the `directory` which ***contains*** the `files`
or `directory` for which ***you want*** to ***view*** the `permissions`, and then ***type*** the
***following*** `command` in `Terminal`:

```shell
ls -l
```

To ***learn how*** to `compress` and `uncompress` ***directories*** from the `Command Line`,
***please visit*** my `article` ***entitled*** [Compressing and uncompressing directories from the Command Line](/posts/compressing-and-uncompressing-directories-from-the-command-line/).

*Happy commanding!*
