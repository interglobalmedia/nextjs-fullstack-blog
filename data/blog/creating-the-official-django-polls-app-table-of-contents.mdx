In this series, I follow the official Django Polls application tutorial. After
refactoring an application which had been created over seven years ago, I
thought the best way to become even more familiar with the Django documentation
would be to follow their Django Polls tutorial and create a Django Polls
application.

1. [Creating the official Django Polls app Part 1](/blog/creating-the-official-django-polls-app-part-1):
   In this section, I create a directory to house my Django Polls application,
   check if I have Django installed, select my Python interpreter, install
   virtualenv with pip, create a virtual environment for Django Polls, activate
   and deactivate the virtual environment, install Django, upgrade Django,
   create a project in Django Polls, initialize git, start up the Django
   development server, create an app called polls, write a first view, create a
   URLconf for the index view, and configure the global URL configuration.
