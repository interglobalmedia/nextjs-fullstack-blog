A **_while back_**, when `Github` **_started adding_** `branch protection rules`, I **_wanted_** to **_make sure_** that **_not just_** `anyone` could **_try_** to **_make_** `pull requests`, `merges`, or `push` to
`remote origin` on my **_public repositories_**. So I **_made sure_** at the
**_very least_** to **_lock_** my `main branch` (or `master` with **_older
repositories_**). **_That way_** it was `“read only”` for **_everyone_**
`except` **_myself_**. **_Later_**, I **_even added_** this `protection` to
`private repositories` **_in case_** if I **_temporarily_** made them `public` for **_whatever reason_**.

But I **_never remember_** getting **_any messages_** referring to these
`branch protection rules` **_until_** `Friday, March 24, 2023`, **_when_**
`someone` at `Github` had **_accidentally published_** `Github`'s **_private_** `SSH key` on a `public repository`. And I **_thought_**,
`“What is going on? Why am I receiving this message, and what does it mean? Because I have admin access to all my repos. I should be able to do whatever I want!”`. And `“Why am I not getting this message when I was pushing to another repository around the same time?”` I had **_not_** set up `branch protection` on **_that branch_** because it was a `private repository`.

**_Now_** I am **_adding_** at the **_very least_** this **_one_**
`branch protection rule`, **_whether_** the `repository` is **_private_** or
**_not_**!

I **_got back_** the **_following_** in `Terminal` **_after running_** the
`git push origin main` **_command_** to `push` my `local repo commits` to
`remote origin` for a **_repository_** in which I **_turned on_**
`“locked branch: read only”` for my `main` (`production`) **_branch_**:

```shell
git push origin main

remote:
remote: - Cannot change this locked branch
remote:
To github.com:interglobalmedia/inter-jobs-api.git
   177ab81..48ba239  main -> main
```

I **_got_** the `message` `“Bypassed rule violations for refs/heads/main”` and `“remote: - Cannot change this locked branch”` **_because_** I **_had
selected_** `“Lock branch Branch is read-only. Users cannot push to the branch.”` **_within_** the **_repository_** `Settings` for **_Branches_** under `Branch Protection Rules`. I **_suppose_**` Git` was **_updated_** to
**_include_** those **_reminders_** to us as to **_which_** `protection(s)` we have **_turned on_** in our **_remote repositories_**, thereby **_letting_** us **_know_** that **_it knows_**, and `Github` **_knows_** and **_recognizes_** that **_those_** `protections` are **_indeed_** in **_place_** and **_working_**.

So **_why weren't_** `protections` **_working_** for `Github` on
`Friday, March 24, 2023`? Or **_whenever_** their `transgression` **_actually_** took **_place_**?

There are **_many other_** `protections` one can **_turn on_**. I will be
**_talking about_** a **_specific one_** that **_could have related_** to
**_what happened_** on `March 24, 2023` in **_another post_**.

**_Happy Git pushing to Github remote!_**
