Code `linting` and `formatting` isn't `just` for JavaScript `development`. `It`
is `also` for `Django` and `Python` development! I `sooo` `recommend` it.
Without `linting` and `formatting` tools and `pre-commit` hooks `to` make sure
`they` are `implemented`, `it` would `be` a big `headache` to `do` it
`manually`, `and` even `unreliable`!

## Adding pre-commit to a Django project

A `pre-commit` is a `review` of `code` before it's `added` to a
`version control system`'s main `repository`. `It's` a `way` to `ensure` that
`code` is `high quality` and `follows` coding `standards`.

`According` to [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/git-hooks),

> Git hooks are scripts that run automatically every time a particular event
> occurs in a Git repository. They let you customize Git’s internal behavior and
> trigger customizable actions at key points in the development life cycle.
> Common use cases for Git hooks include encouraging a commit policy, altering
> the project environment depending on the state of the repository, and
> implementing continuous integration workflows. But, since scripts are
> infinitely customizable, you can use Git hooks to automate or optimize
> virtually any aspect of your development workflow.

`In` our `case`, `we` are `adding` a `pre-commit` hook to a `Django` project.
The `Django` projects I `added` the `pre-commit` hooks `to` are
[Django Polls](https://github.com/interglobalmedia/django-polls) and
[Django Boards](https://github.com/interglobalmedia/django-boards).

`A` pre-commit `hook` is a `local hook`. A `local hook` affects `only` the
`repository` in `which` it `resides`. The `thing` to `know` about `local hooks`
is that `developers` can `modify` their `own` local `hooks`, `so` we `can't` use
`them` to `enforce` commit `policies`, for example. But `they` can `make` it
`easier` for `developers` to `stick` to `certain rules`.

A `pre-commit` is `executed` every `time` we `run` a `git commit` before the
`we` are `able` to `make` our `commit message`. `The` pre-commit `checks` to
`make sure` that the `commit` being `made` follows `the` rules `set` by
`linters` or `code formatters` being `used`, for example. `If` our `changes`
don't `meet` those `standards`, `we` can't `make` our `commit`. `Sometimes` the
`code formatters` or `linters` will `automatically fix` the `issues` so we're
`ready` to `re-commit` our `changes`, `but` other `times` they `will` only
t`ell` us `what` and `where` an `issue` needs `to` be `fixed`.

The [pre-commit framework](https://pre-commit.com) `manages` and `maintains`
multi-language `pre-commit` hooks. `That` is `what` we `will` be `installing`.

### Installing pre-commit

`Since` we are `dealing` with `Django`, we `will` install `pre-commit` with
`pip`:

```shell
pip install pre-commit
```

`Make sure` that `you` have `activated` your `virtual environment` before
`running` the `pip` command.

### Configuring pre-commit

`Next`, we `have` to `configure` pre-commit. `To` do `that`, we `need` to
`create` a `file` called `.pre-commit-config.yaml` inside the `root` of our
`Django` project:

```shell
touch .pre-commit-config.yaml
```

`I` first `added` the `following` to my `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file:

```yaml
repos:
    - repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks
      rev: v5.0.0
      hooks:
          - id: check-yaml
          - id: end-of-file-fixer
          - id: trailing-whitespace
```

`The` above `configuration` uses `hooks` from the `pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks`
repository on `GitHub`. The `current version` is `5.0.0`.

`If` you `want` to `make sure` that `all` your `hooks` are `up` to `date`, `you`
can `run` the following `command`:

```shell
pre-commit autoupdate
```

1. `check-yaml` tries to `load` all `yaml` files and `verify` their `syntax`.
1. `end-of-file-fixer` makes `sure` that `files` end `in` a `new line` and
   `only` a `new line`.
1. `trailing-whitespace` trims `trailing whitespace`.

`You` can `check out` the `pre-commit` repository on `GitHub` for a `list` of
`other` hooks `prvided` by `pre-commit`. `They` also `have` their
`documentation` at [pre-commit.com](https://pre-commit.com/). It's `worth`
checking `out`!

### Running the pre-commit install command

Once `we` have `added` our `first configuration` to `.pre-commit-config.yaml`,
we `run` the `following command`:

```shell
pre-commit install
```

This `will` set `up` the `hooks` we `add` to `.pre-commit-config.yaml` locally.
After `installation`, `every time` we run `git commit`, the `configured hooks`
will `run` on the (`git`) `staged` files.

We `can` also `run` the command `pre-commit run --all-files` against `all`
project `files` instead `of` just the `ones` that `are` being `committed`.
`This way`, `especially` when `using` pre-commit `on` a `project` for the
`first time`, we `can` get `rid` of the `initial` heavy `lifting` so as `not` to
`do` it `when` actually `making` our `commits`. `When` I ran
`pre-commit run --all-files` against my `Django Boards` application for the
`first time`, `there` were `A LOT` of `fixes` to be `made`. `If` I `had` simply
`started` to `commit` my `files`, I `would` have `made` a `lot` more
`unnecessary work` for myself! After that, `simply` running `git commit` should
`not` be `so bad`!

`The` check-yaml `hook` should `automatically fix` any `issues`. `After` running
`pre-commit run --all-files` and then `git status`, `we` are `ready` to `commit`
our `changes`. They `should` be `successful` because `all` our `issues` have
`been fixed`.

## Configuring Black

`Black` is a `Python` formatter `that` I `use` in `VSCode`. `As` per `Black`'s
`documentation`,

> Black is a PEP 8 compliant opinionated formatter with its own style.

`PEP 8` is the `official` style `guide` for `Python` code.

`Pre-commit` will n`ot` run `on` files `that` are `ignored` by `Git` (`added` to
a `.gitignore` file). `In` Django `projects`, we `track` our `migration` files,
`but` it `really` is `not` a `good idea` to `pre-commit` those `files`. `They`
are `auto-generated` by `Django`, `so` it is `better` to `leave` them
`untouched`.

`That` being `said`, `we` should `add` the `following` to the `top` of the
`.pre-commit-config.yaml` file:

```yaml
exclude: .*migrations\/.*
```

`Next`, `let's` configure `Black` in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`:

```yaml
- repo: https://github.com/psf/black
    rev: 24.10.0
    hooks:
    -   id: black
        language_version: python3.13
```

I also add the following:

```yaml
- repo: https://github.com/psf/black-pre-commit-mirror
    rev: 24.10.0
    hooks:
      - id: black
        # It is recommended to specify the latest version of Python
        # supported by your project here, or alternatively use
        # pre-commit's default_language_version, see
        # https://pre-commit.com/#top_level-default_language_version
        language_version: python3.13
```

`The` first `configuration` I `added` myself `as` per `pre-commit` docs. `The`
second `Hana` added. The `first` is `just` the `default configuration`, `and`
does `not` have `to` be `used`.` I` have `since` removed `it`.

`rev` refers to `the` latest `version` of `Black`. `The` current `version` is
`24.10.0`.

`Black` recommends `specifying` the `latest version` of the `language_version`
used `in` our `project`, `which` is `Python`. The `current` latest `version` I
am `using` in my `project` is `3.13`.

### Customizing our black settings

We `customize` our `black` settings `using` a `file` called `pyproject.toml`.

`pyproject.toml` is a `configuration` file `used` in `Python` projects. It
`specifies` project `information` in a `standardized way`. `pyproject.toml` is
`also` used `by` packaging `tools` as `well` as `other tools` such as `linters`,
`type checkers`, etc.

1. The `[build-system]` table `is` strongly `recommended`. `It` allows `us` to
   `declare` which
   [build backend](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/glossary/#term-Build-Backend)
   we `use` and `which` other `dependencies` are `needed` to `build` our
   `project`.
1. The `[project]` table `is` the `format` that `most` build backends `use` to
   `specify` our `project's` basic `metadata`, `such` as `dependencies`, our
   `name`, etc.
1. The `[tool]` table `has` tools-specific `subtables`, i.e., `[tool.hatch]`,
   `[tool.black]`, `[tool.mypy]`. The `contents` of the `table` are `defined` by
   `each tool`. `We` should `consult` the `particular tool`'s `documentation` to
   `know` what `it` can `contain`. `To` learn `more` about `pyproject.toml`,
   please visit
   [Writing your pyproject.toml](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/writing-pyproject-toml/)
   in the `Python Packaging User Guide`.

In `our` case `here`, regarding `customizing` black `settings`, `we` should
`add` the `followin`g to the `top` of our `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[tool.black]
line-length = 88
target-version = ['py313']
include = '\.pyi?$'
```

1. `line-length` describes `how` many `characters` are `allowed` per `line`. The
   `default` is `88`.

1. `target-version` describes `Python` versions `that` should be `supported` by
   `Black's` output. `To` learn `more` about other `configurations`, please
   visit
   [Usage and Configuration](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage_and_configuration/).

`Pre-commit` will `detect` these `configurations` and `check` our `project`
against `them`.

After `adding` this `new hook`, we `should` run `pre-commit run --all-files`
again.

`It` is `probable` that a `lot` of `things` become `formatted` by `Black` as a
`result` of `running` the `pre-commit run --all-files` command. `We` should then
`stage` and `commit` those `changes`.

## Configuring isort

[isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/) is a `tool` which `"sorts"` our
`imports` `"so we don't have to"`.

`According` to the [isort documentation](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/),

> isort is a Python utility / library to sort imports alphabetically, and
> automatically separated into sections and by type. It provides a command line
> utility, Python library and
> [plugins for various editors](https://github.com/pycqa/isort/wiki/isort-Plugins)
> to quickly sort all your imports. It requires Python 3.7+ to run but supports
> formatting Python 2 code too.

`isort` also `works` in `accordance` with `PEP 8`.

`Next`, we `add` the `following` to our `.pre-commit-config.yaml`:

```yaml
- repo: https://github.com/pycqa/isort
    rev: 5.13.2
    hooks:
      - id: isort
        name: isort (python)
```

`We` can also `customize` our i`sort` settings `in` our `pyproject.toml` file.
`We` can `add` the `following` right `below` our `existing` black `settings`:

```toml
[tool.isort]
profile = "django"
combine_as_imports = true
include_trailing_comma = true
line_length = 88
multi_line_output = 3
known_first_party = ["config"]
```

Certain `profile(s)` such as `black`, `django`, `pycharm`, `google`,
`open_stack`, `plone`, `attrs`, `hug`, `wemake`, and `appnexus` are `built` into
`isort` to `allow` easy `interoperability` with `common projects` and
`code styles`.

1. To `use` any `of` the `above profiles` in our `pyproject.toml` file, `we` use
   `profile=PROFILE_NAME`. `Above`, we use `profile = "django"`.
1. `combine_as_imports` is `specific` to `Django`, `and` the `value` to `assign`
   is `"true"`, `just` as `above`. This `setting` combines `as` imports `on` the
   `same line`.
1. `include_trailing_comma` includes a `trailing comma` on `multi-line` imports
   `that` include `parentheses`.
1. `line-length` refers `to` the `max-length` of `an` import `line` (`used` for
   `wrapping` long `imports`). `It` should `be` the `same` sa `black's`,
   `otherwise` an `error` will be `thrown` and the `commit` will `fail`.
1. `multi_line_output` defines how `from` imports "wrap" when `they` go `past`
   the `line_length` limit.
1. `known_first_party` forces `isort` to `recognize` a `module` as `being` part
   `of` the `current` Python `project`. `It` should `be` the `name` of our
   `Django` project.

To `learn` more `about` other `configuration` options, please visit
[Configuration options for isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/docs/configuration/options.html).

`Now` let's run `pre-commit run --all-files` again. The `result` of `running`
this `command` will `probably` be `that` isort `fixes` a `lot` of `files`. We
`have` also `updated` the `pre-commit` config `to` trim `trailing whitespaces`.

`Again`, `we` can `stage` and `commit` our `changes`.

## Configuring Flake8

[Flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) is a `popular` linting `tool` for
`Python` code. `It` is a `command-line` utility `for` enforcing `style`
consistency `across` Python `projects`. `By default` it `is` a `wrapper` that
`includes` lint `checks` provided `by` the `PyFlakes` project, `PEP-0008`
inspired `style` checks `provided` by the `PyCodeStyle` project, `and` McCabe
`complexity` checking `provided` by the `McCabe` project. `It` will `also` run
`third-party` extensions `if` they are `found` and `installed`.

Now `we` will `add` the `following` to the `bottom` of our
`.pre-commit-config.yaml` file:

```yaml
- repo: https://github.com/pycqa/flake8
    rev: 7.1.1
    hooks:
      - id: flake8
```

`Flake8` supports `storing` its `configuration` in our `project` in `one` of
`setup.cfg`, `tox.ini`, or `.flake8` file. `We` are `going` to `go` with
`.flake8`.

### Creating a .flake8 configuration file

`First`, we `run` the `touch .flake8` command `to` create our `.flake8` file.
`Then` we `add` the `following` to `it`:

```shell
[flake8]
max-line-length = 88
```

`To` learn `more` about `other` configuration `options`, please visit
[Configuring Flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/user/configuration.html).

`Now` let's run `pre-commit run --all-files` again.

`As` we `will` see, `flake8` does `not` automatically `fix` our `issues` for
`us`. `It` only `tells` us `what` is `wrong` and `where`. `Hana Belay` describes
the `type` of `issues` that she `encountered` in her `project` she `uses` in her
`article` entitled
[Django Code Formatting and Linting Made Easy: A Step-by-Step Pre-commit Hook Tutorial](https://dev.to/earthcomfy/django-code-formatting-and-linting-made-easy-a-step-by-step-pre-commit-hook-tutorial-592f)
on [dev.to](https://dev.to). I `used` my `own` projects, so `things` were `a`
bit `different`. `They` were `even` a `bit` different `from` each `other`!

`In` my `Django Polls` project, I `added` the `following` inside `.flake8`:

```shell
[flake8]
max-line-length = 88
ignore = E501, W503
per-file-ignores =
    config/settings/*:F405 F403 F401
```

`E501` is `for` when `lines` are `too long`. `W503` is for `line break` before
`binary operator`. The `reason` we `ignore` W503 `out` of the `gates` is because
`W503` and `W504` rules `conflict` with `each other`. To `avoid` such
`conflicts`, we `add` one `of` them `to` our `ignore`. `I` add `W503`,
`following` Hana's `tutorial`.

`We` may `get` E501 `errors` because `Black` doesn't `know` how to `operate` on
`strings`. `We` can `ignore` such `warnings`.` We` also `can` ignore `W503`
warnings regarding `line break before binary operator`. This `results` in `the`
line `ignore = E501, W503`.

`Other` issues `F401`, `E712`, and `F841` get `fixed`. `The` final `.flake8`
contents `for` my `Django Polls` project `is` the `following`:

```shell
[flake8]
max-line-length = 88
ignore = E501, W503
per-file-ignores =
    config/settings/*:F405 F403 F401
```

`The` same `as` Hana's `.flake8` contents. `HOWEVER`, when `I` added `linting`
and `code formatting` for `Django Boards`, `which` is a `much more` complex
`project`, `I` ended `up` with `the` following `.flake8`:

```shell
[flake8]
max-line-length = 88
ignore = F401, F403, F405, E501, W503, F541, F821, F841
per-file-ignores =
    config/settings/*:F405 F403 F401
```

I `still` include `E501` and `W503`, `but` I `had` my `own` reasons `for`
including `the` other `rules` to `ignore`.

After `adding` the `flake8` configurations to `.flake8`, we `run`
`pre-commit run --all-files` again. Everything `should` be `fixed` and `ready`
for `commit`.

## Configuring djlint

`I` already `was` using `Djlint` in my `Django` projects. `However`, my
`configuration` was not o`ptimal`. `Using` pre-commit `optimized` the
`configuration` of `this` invaluable `tool`.

Djlint `formats` and `lints` Django `HTML` templates.

`Next`, we `add` the `following` to our `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file:

```yaml
- repo: https://github.com/djlint/djLint
    rev: v1.36.4
    hooks:
      - id: djlint-reformat-django
      - id: djlint-django
```

To `customize` our `djLint` settings, `we` can `use` the `pyproject.toml` file.
`We` can `add` the `following` there:

```toml
[tool.djlint]
profile = "django"
ignore = "H020,H021"
```

Hana `adds` the `following`:

```toml
[tool.djlint]
profile = "django"
ignore = "H031"
```

"H031" `checks` for the `presence` of `meta keywords`. I `already` had
`meta keywords` added `to` my `project`, `and` didn't `feel` the `need` to `add`
it `there`. `However`, in `future projects` it `might` be a `good idea` to `add`
it `instead` of just `depending` on the `linting errors` that `appear` in the
`templates` and `then` doing `nothing` about `them`. To `learn more` about
`other` djLint `linting rules`, please visit
[djlint Linter Usage](https://www.djlint.com/docs/linter/) in the djLint docs.

`I` add `something` slightly `different` to my `Django Boards` pyproject.toml
`for` djlint:

```toml
[tool.djlint]
profile = "django"
ignore = "H020,H021"
line_length = 88
```

`One thing` I think `important` to `mention`. DO NOT `add` djlint `comments` at
`the` very `top` (first line) of `your` Django `templates`. I `read` somewhere
`that` that's the `way` I `should` do `it` (I `subsequently` found `out` that
was `wrong` in the [djLint docs](https://www.djlint.com/docs/ignoring-code/)),
`and` it `resulted` in a `"Bad Gateway 502"` in `production` as well as a
`syntax error` in `development`. `Make sure` to `check` all your
`linting changes` before `merging` into your `main branch` and `pushing` to
`production`! `That` will `save` you a `"Bad Gateway 502"` or even a `500`
status `code` in `production`!

## Running pre-commit in Continuous Integration

To `learn more` about running `pre-commit` in `Continuous Integration`, please
visit `Hana Belay's` article on `dev.to` entitled
[Django Code Formatting and Linting Made Easy: A Step-by-Step Pre-commit Hook Tutorial](https://dev.to/earthcomfy/django-code-formatting-and-linting-made-easy-a-step-by-step-pre-commit-hook-tutorial-592f).
`It` is `very easy` to `set up`, `and` she `has` great `screenshots` to
`help make` the `process` easier to `follow`.

## Conclusion

In this post, we added the pre-commit framework to a Django Project, configured
pre-commit, added and configured the black autoformatter, the isort code
formatter, the flake8 linter, and the djLint template linter and formatter.
