I was **_setting up_** `husky` for a **_project_** I am **_working on_**, and
for **_some reason_**, my `husky` **_pre-commit_** `hook` was `“not executable”`
by **_default_**. When I **_made_** a `commit`, I **_got_** the **_following
back_** in my `VS Code Integrated Terminal`:

```shell
hint: The '.husky/pre-commit' hook was ignored because it's not set as executable.
hint: You can disable this warning with git config advice.ignoredHook false.
```

I **_don’t remember_** ever **_having had_** that **_problem_** in the
**_past_**, but **_apparently_** this is a **_very old_** `issue`. In the
**_thread_** on the
[husky repository on Github](https://github.com/typicode/husky/issues/1177),
someone **_shared_** the **_following solution_**:

```shell
chmod ug+x .husky/*
```

I **_delved deeper_** into **_this issue_**, and actually **_found_** the
**_person’s solution_** on
[stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8598639/why-is-my-git-pre-commit-hook-not-executable-by-default/73330791#73330791).

So far **_everything_** `works beautifully`. If **_anything_** does
**_change_**, I will **_update_** this `post`. I **_think_** I **_did_** the
**_same thing_** as **_someone_** within the `stackoverflow thread` did. It is
the **_following_**:

```md
I got my solution. I added pre-commit file manually so it was not
executable(644). I removed pre-commit file and added using this command yarn
husky add .husky/pre-commit that makes pre-commit file executable(755) and works
fine (on) any new branch.

So, to solve this type of issue, we have to avoid adding manual hook file and
use this command yarn husky add .husky/<hookname> to add.
```

I **_used_** `npm`, so if you are **_also using_** `npm`, **_replace_**
`yarn add` with `npm i`. - **_refer_** to
