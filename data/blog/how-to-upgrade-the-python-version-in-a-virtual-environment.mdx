`I` was `working` on a `new project` today (the `official` Django `Polls` app
`tutorial` as a matter of fact), `and` I `noticed` that my `virtual environment`
was `using` Python `3.12`. `But` in `my project`, `I` am `using` Python
`3.13.0`. `Using` different `versions` of `Python` in the `virtual environment`
vs `in` the `code` can `create problems` and `conflicts`. I `had` to `upgrade`
my `version` of `Python` in my `venv` folder `pronto`!

## Activating the virtual environment

`First`, I `had` to `make sure` that my `virtual environment` was `activated` in
my `project`:

```shell
source venv/bin/activate
```

## Saving my current dependencies

`Next`, I `had` to `make sure` to `save` my `application`'s current
`dependencies`:

```shell
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

## De-activating the virtual environment

`Next`, I `had` to `deactivate` the `virtual environment`:

```shell
deactivate
```

## Deleting the current venv folder

`Next`, I `had` to `delete` the `current` venv `folder`. `That` is `what` I
`call` my `virtual` environment `folder`. `You` might `call` it
`something else`!

## Creating a new venv folder

`Next`, I `had` to `create` a `new` venv `folder` using `3.13` since `that` is
`what` I `wanted` to `upgrade` to:

```shell
python3.13 -m venv venv
```

## Re-activating the virtual environment

`Next`, I `had` to `re-activate` the `virtual environment`:

```shell
source venv/bin/activate
```

## Installing saved dependencies

`Next`, I `had` to `install` my `saved dependencies`:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

And that's it!

## Conclusion

`In` this `post`, I `showed` how to `upgrade` the `Python version` being `used`
in a `Django` application's `virtual environment`.
