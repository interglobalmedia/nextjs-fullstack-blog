I **_just found_** out **_why_** `some developers` **_prefer working_** with
`Chrome Developer Tools`, **_some prefer_** working with
`Firefox Browser Tools`, and **_some prefer_** `Safari Web Inspector`. And it is **_not necessarily_** for the **_“obvious” reasons_**.

Until **_very recently_**, I **_preferred working_** with
`Chrome Developer Tools`, because I **_considered_** the `DX`
(`developer experience`) the **_most intuitive_**. In **_that sense_**, it
**_still is_**. **_However_**, I have **_also_** very **_recently_** been
getting `“unknown” notifications` from `Chrome`, which I **_absolutely know_** **_must be_** from `“phishing” sites`. And that is **_NOT good_** and **_NOT secure_**.

**_Below_** is a `screenshot` of `Chrome Developer Tools` when I **_go in_**
`using` the `Option + Command + J` **_short cut_** and **_select_** the
`Sources tab`:

***Chrome Developer Tools Sources tab***

**_Then_** I **_started using_** `Firefox`. That **_definitely_** is **_more
secure_** and **_private_**, but the `DX` is **_not_** the **_best_** as far as their `browser tools` go. AND there is **_no_** `Chrome Sources tab`
**_equivalent_**. Which just did **_not seem_** to **_initially work_** for
**_me_**.

**_Then_** I **_checked out_** `Safari`. They are **_much better_** than they **_used_** to **_be_**, and they DO have a `Chrome Sources tab`
**_equivalent_**. I **_think_** I will be `working` **_between_** `Firefox` and `Safari`. `Chrome` **_has_** to **_go_**, **_except_** for when **_testing_** for `cross-browser compatibilities`. AND when I **_use_** `Safari` or `Firefox` to **_land_** on `sites` which are `asset heavy`, i.e. **_lots_** of **_images_** that have `lazy-loading` **_implemented_**, the `Lighthouse audit` in `Firefox` is **_double_** the `score` of `Chrome`, and `load time` **_in general_** is **_very quick_** in `Safari`. That is **_because_** of **_all those_** `Chrome background trackers` and `plugins` that **_exist_** in the `browser`, and which can **_severely damage_** `site performance`.

This is **_what_** `Safari Web Inspector` **_looks like_**:

![The Safari Web Inspector](safari_web_inspector.webp)

***The Safari Web Inspector***

What I **_do like_** about `Safari` is that `ALL ASSETS` **_used_** on a `page` are **_listed_** and can be **_fully inspected_**, **_including_** things like `Google Fonts`, **_for example_**. The `screenshot` **_above_** is the `home page` of the `example site` I **_created_** for my `Web Design 1` class (my **_last class_** `teaching` it will be **_next_** `Wednesday`,
`December 14`, `2022`, **_freeing myself_** for a **_next “adventure”_**), and on **_that page_** I **_have_** a `background image`, `Google Font`(s),
**_two_** `JavaScript files` which **_reside_** in a `scripts folder`, a
`main.css` file which **_resides_** in a `styles folder`, and then a `CSS2` file for my `Google Font`. And **_all this_** `appears` **_under_** the
`Web Inspector Sources tab`, the **_equivalent_** of the
`Chrome Developer Tools Sources tab`. But perhaps **_even better_**, because the `Web Inspector` also **_opens up_** in a **_new_** `window`, which makes **_working inside_** the `Inspector` **_much easier!_** What is ALSO **_very cool_** is that `Safari` **_also has_** a `Graphics tab`:

![Safari empty graphics tab](safari_empty_graphics.webp)

***Safari empty graphics tab***

**_Of course_** my `Graphics tab` does **_not show anything_** on the
`Home page` of **_this site_** because there is **_nothing_** going on
**_animation-wise_** there. **_However_**, when I **_go_** to the `about.html` page of the **_site_**, it is a **_different story_**. **_There_**, I **_have added_** (3) `animation layers`:

![Safari active Graphics tab](safari_active_graphics_tab.webp)

***Safari active Graphics tab***

And it **_even states_** `where` the `animation` is **_defined_** in the
`HTML markup`, and the **_name_** of the `animation` in the `CSS code`. How
**_cool_** is **_that_**?

**_Now_** let’s **_take_** a **_look_** at `Firefox`. The `DX` **_there_** is **_not_** as **_intuitive_**:

![Firefox Browser Tools Style Editor tab](firefox_browser_tools_style_editor.webp)

***Firefox Browser Tools Style Editor tab***

I actually **_had_** to **_look up_** how to **_find_** the `JavaScript files` **_driving_** a `page`:

- [Introduction to Firefox Debugger](https://mozilladevelopers.github.io/playground/debugger/).

I **_went into_** the `Firefox Browser Tools`, and then **_selected_** the
`Debugger tab`. Then I **_opened up_** `“Main Thread”` by **_clicking_** on its `dropdown arrow`, and **_inside_** was the **_link_** to the **_page_** I was on:

![The Firefox Browser Tools Debugger tab](firefox_browser_tools_debugger_tab.webp)

***The Firefox Browser Tools Debugger tab***

Then I **_clicked_** on the **_site url_**, and the **_following appeared_**:

![The Firefox Browser Tools Main Thread Scripts Folder](firefox_browser_tools_main_thread_scripts_folder.webp)

***The Firefox Browser Tools Main Thread Scripts Folder***

My `scripts folder` **_containing_** the `JavaScript files` which were **_being used_** on the **_active page_** with the **_help_** of `script tags` located **_right above_** the **_closing_** `body tag` in the `HTML markup`. And when I **_clicked_** on **_one_** of the **_files_**, the **_following appeared_**:

![The Firefox Browser Tools Main Thread JavaScript Files](firefox_browser_tools_main_thread_javascript_files.webp)

***The Firefox Browser Tools Main Thread JavaScript Files***

So **_yes_**, we **_can_** get to the **_same places_** in **_all three_**
`browsers`, but the `paths` and `experiences` **_getting there_** are
**_dramatically different_**. After **_better acquainting_** myself with
`Firefox` and `Safari`, I **_could see_** `using both`. And `device mode`
(**_responsive design mode_**) in `Firefox` **_definitely_** `competes well`
**_against_** `Chrome`. It **_might_** be **_even better!_**

**_Sometimes_** we **_stick_** with `tools` which **_may not_** be the
**_safest_** or **_not_** the **_best_** for `site performance` **_because_** we **_don’t know_** any better or we are **_resistant_** to **_change_**. But if we **_just take_** a **_bit_** of **_time_** to **_get_** to **_know_** the **_competition_**, we just **_might find_** `happiness` in **_switching_**!

**_Happy Developer Tooling across browsers!_**
