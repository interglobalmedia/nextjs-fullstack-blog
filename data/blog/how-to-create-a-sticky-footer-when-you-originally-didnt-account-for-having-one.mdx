For the past couple of weeks I have been working on an app I am calling
`Message Me`. I think it was partially in reaction to my **_utter_**
**disappointment** and **_departure_** from **Facebook**. I wanted to create a simple, clean, message app with persistent data stored in a **NoSQL/MongoDB** database on the **_backend_**, **GraphQL** **_API_**, **Node.js** **_server_**, and **React** **_frontend_**.

I still have much more I want to add over time feature-wise, but the basic
structure is complete.

I ran into a few **_challenges_** along the way, and one of them was figuring out how to create a **sticky footer** **_after_** already having completed the app structure. I hadn't been sure what I wanted to do with a footer and whether I even wanted a real one in the first place, so when I finally decided that I DID want one, I found that I would have to approach the sticky footer in a very different way from what I had done in the past.

Why? First of all, my `Layout` **component** was structured and utilized
differently from other apps I had created. It was not straightforward. For
example, in my high order `App` **component**, I wrap the `Layout` **component** only around the `header`, don't include the main body of the app (`<main></main>`) or the footer (`<footer></footer>`). The `return`
**statement** looks like this:

```js
return (
	<Fragment>
		{this.state.showBackdrop && (
			<Backdrop onClick={this.backdropClickHandler} />
		)}
		<ErrorHandler
			error={this.state.errorHandler}
			onHandle={this.errorHandler}
		/>
		<HeaderLayout
			header={
				<Toolbar>
					<MainNavigation
						onOpenMobileNav={this.mobileNavHandler.bind(this, true)}
						onLogout={this.logoutHandler}
						isAuth={this.state.isAuth}
					/>
				</Toolbar>
			}
			mobileNav={
				<MobileNavigation
					open={this.state.showMobileNav}
					mobile
					onChooseItem={this.mobileNavHandler.bind(this, false)}
					onLogout={this.logoutHandler}
					isAuth={this.state.isAuth}
				/>
			}
		/>
		{routes}
	</Fragment>
)
```

And this is what my `Layout` **component** looked like:

```js
import React, { Fragment } from 'react'
import './Layout.scss'
import Footer from '../../Footer/Footer'

const Layout = (props) => (
	<Fragment>
		<div className="Site">
			<header className="main-header">{props.header}</header>
			{props.mobileNav}
			<main className="Site-content">
				<div className="content">{props.children}</div>
			</main>
		</div>
	</Fragment>
)
export default Layout
```

All code in `App.js` is related to user sign up and log in. This is because of the existence of **_user authentication_** for the purpose of **_protecting routes_** so **_unauthenticated_** **users** can't access them. In order to be able to protect any given routes, it has to be done at the **_highest_** **level**, and that is `App.js`. That means the main content is not included and the footer would not be included if it did not contain authentication routes which needed protection.

At first I tried to approach things the way I would with a simple website with no authentication involved. When I had created websites using views and
authentication created with `EJS`, `Handlebars`, or `Pug`, for example, I didn't have this problem, because those **routes** are **_structured_**
**differently**. So I first did what I already was familiar with. I take that approach with development workflows as well and **refactor** what needs
**_refactoring_** as I go along. `React`, and `create-react-app`, is great about letting you know what needs to be **_fixed_**. The `Terminal` AND
`browser console`, such as `Google Chrome DevTools`, should be your **_best_** **friends**.

Suffice it to say, **_adding_** a `Footer` **component** to my `Layout`
**component** and **_accompanying_** `sticky footer styling` **_adapted_** from **Philip Walton**, **_creator_** of `Flexbox`, in an `SCSS` stylesheet
(`./styles/styles.scss`) in the `src` **directory** of the **project** did NOT work. **_Adding_** the **styles** to a `Layout.scss` file also did not work. Etc.

I took another overall look at what was going on **_structurally_** with the
**site**. I did not want to **_completely_** **refactor** the `structure`. That would have been **_nasty_** and not necessarily successful. There had to be another way of fixing the issue. There was, and the answer stared me straight in the face in `App.js`!

I decided to **_split_** my `Layout.js` in **two**. I created a
`HeaderLayout.js` and a `MainLayout.js`. I imported the `HeaderLayout.js` into `App.js`, with no need to do any refactoring whatsoever there. Everything else remained the same. In `HeaderLayout.scss`, I imported the `.main-header` **className** which was present in the **_original_** `Layout.scss.`

**Implementation** of `MainLayout.js` was a bit more **_extensive_**. I had to `import` it into **_individual_** **pages**. I had to import it into my **Feed** page `Feed.js`, my **Single Message** page `SingleMessage.js`, the **Signup** page `Signup.js`, and the **Login** page `Login.js`. This is how the `Login.js` code looked like after I imported `MainLayout.js`:

```js
import React, { Component } from 'react'

import Input from '../../components/Form/Input/Input'
import Button from '../../components/Button/Button'
import { required, length, email } from '../../util/validators'
import Auth from './Auth'

class Login extends Component {
	state = {
		loginForm: {
			email: {
				value: '',
				valid: false,
				touched: false,
				validators: [required, email],
			},
			password: {
				value: '',
				valid: false,
				validators: [required, length({ min: 5 })],
			},
			formIsValid: false,
		},
	}

	inputChangeHandler = (input, value) => {
		this.setState((prevState) => {
			let isValid = true
			for (const validator of prevState.loginForm[input].validators) {
				isValid = isValid && validator(value)
			}
			const updatedForm = {
				...prevState.loginForm,
				[input]: {
					...prevState.loginForm[input],
					valid: isValid,
					value: value,
				},
			}
			let formIsValid = true
			for (const inputName in updatedForm) {
				formIsValid = formIsValid && updatedForm[inputName].valid
			}
			return {
				loginForm: updatedForm,
				formIsValid: formIsValid,
			}
		})
	}

	inputBlurHandler = (input) => {
		this.setState((prevState) => {
			return {
				loginForm: {
					...prevState.loginForm,
					[input]: {
						...prevState.loginForm[input],
						touched: true,
					},
				},
			}
		})
	}

	render() {
		return (
			<Auth>
				<form
					onSubmit={(e) =>
						this.props.onLogin(e, {
							email: this.state.loginForm.email.value,
							password: this.state.loginForm.password.value,
						})
					}
				>
					<Input
						id="email"
						label="Your E-Mail"
						type="email"
						control="input"
						onChange={this.inputChangeHandler}
						onBlur={this.inputBlurHandler.bind(this, 'email')}
						value={this.state.loginForm['email'].value}
						valid={this.state.loginForm['email'].valid}
						touched={this.state.loginForm['email'].touched}
					/>
					<Input
						id="password"
						label="password"
						type="password"
						control="input"
						onChange={this.inputChangeHandler}
						onBlur={this.inputBlurHandler.bind(this, 'password')}
						value={this.state.loginForm['password'].value}
						valid={this.state.loginForm['password'].valid}
						touched={this.state.loginForm['password'].touched}
					/>
					<Button
						design="raised"
						type="submit"
						loading={this.props.loading}
					>
						Login
					</Button>
				</form>
			</Auth>
		)
	}
}

export default Login
```

I essentially did the **_same_** with the `Signup.js`, `Feed.js`, and
`SingleMessage.js` pages.

And this is my famous sticky footer styling adapted from
[Philip Walton](https://philipwalton.github.io/solved-by-flexbox/demos/sticky-footer/), creator of `Flexbox`:

```scss
:root {
	--space: 1.5em 0;
	--space: 2em 0;
}
.Site {
	display: flex;
	flex-direction: column;
	height: 100vh;
}
.Site-content {
	flex: 1 0 auto;
	padding: var(--space) var(--space) 0;
	width: 100%;
}
.Site-content:after {
	content: '\00a0';
	display: block;
	margin-top: var(--space);
	height: 0;
	visibility: hidden;
}
```

I **_added_** the **sticky footer styling** to the **_highest order_**
**stylesheet**, `index.scss`, so that it would **_affect_** any other
**component** or **page** below it, **_including_** `App.js`. It is also the
**_only_** `scss` file I had to `import` into `index.js`, because I use `scss` **modules** in this project. In other words, **_each_** **component** and **page** has its **_own_** `scss` **file** which **_only affects_** the **styles** of the `component` or `page` it is **_imported_** **into**.

And that was it! No need for any crazy refactoring of app structure or frontend code. I saved soooo much time, energy, and frustration. This could very well have been a real situation. What if a client or the company one works for had decided to make such a move, and there was a very limited time to implement the footer? This would be an ideal solution for such a scenario.
