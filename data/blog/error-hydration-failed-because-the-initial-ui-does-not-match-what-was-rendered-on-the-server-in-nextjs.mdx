I **_just discovered_** (**_right now_**) that if I have **_invalid_** `JSX` in one `Next.js` **_page component_**, and **_different_** `JSX` (which is **_valid_** let’s say) in **_another_** `Next.js` **_page component_** which is **_part_** of the **_same_** `UI`, I get a `hydration error`. Let’s say I **_have_** the **_following_** in my `Home` (page) `component`:

```jsx
// pages/index.js
export default function Home({ users }) {
	return (
		<div className={styles.container}>
			<table id="users">
				<tr>
					<th>Name</th>
					<th>Email</th>
					<th>Details</th>
				</tr>
				{users.map((user) => (
					<tr key={user.id}>
						<td>{user.name}</td>
						<td>{user.email}</td>
						<Link
							style={{ color: '#4caf50' }}
							href={`/users/${user.id}`}
						>
							View Details
						</Link>
					</tr>
				))}
			</table>
		</div>
	)
}
```

**_However_**, in `pages/users/[id].js`, the `JSX` **_looks like_** the
**_following_**:

```jsx
export default function Home({ user }) {

    export default function Home({ user }) {

    return (
        <div className={styles.container}>
            <table id='users'>
                <tr>
                    <th>Name</th>
                    <th>Email</th>
                    <th>Phone No</th>
                    <th>website</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>{user.name}</td>
                    <td>{user.email}</td>
                    <td>{user.phone}</td>
                    <td>{user.website}</td>
                </tr>
            </table>

            <Link href='/'>
                <a style={{ marginTop: '3rem' }}><b>Go Back</b></a>
            </Link>

        </div>
    )
}
```

When I **_went_** to the `browser` to **_check_** my `application`, I **_saw_** the **_following error_**:

![Next.js hydration error](nextjs-hydration-error.webp)

***Next.js hydration error***

I wasn’t **_quite sure_** what was **_going on_**, so I **_went_** into
`Chrome Developer Tools` **_itself_** to see what `error` I was **_getting
there_** and the **_following_** is what was **_returned_**:

```shell
next-dev.js?3515:20 Warning: Expected server HTML to contain a matching <table> in <div>.
    at table
    at div
    at Home (webpack-internal:///./pages/index.js:17:11)
    at MyApp (webpack-internal:///./pages/_app.js:9:11)
    at PathnameContextProviderAdapter
```

This told me **_immediately_** that there **_must be_** an **_error_** in the
`JSX`, but I **_still wanted_** to **_know why_** I would **_get_** this
`error`, so I **_read more_** about this `hydration error` in the
`Next.js docs`. And the **_following_** is **_what_** I **_came up_** with:

> [React Hydration Error](https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/react-hydration-error)
[Why This Error Occurred](https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/react-hydration-error#why-this-error-occurred)
While rendering your application, there was a difference between the React tree that was pre-rendered (SSR/SSG) and the React tree that rendered during the first render in the Browser. The first render is called Hydration which is a [feature of React](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html#hydrate). This can cause the React tree to be out of sync with the DOM and result in unexpected content/attributes being present.

The first render is called Hydration which is a feature of React. This can cause the React tree to be out of sync with the DOM and result in unexpected content/attributes being present.

As for the hydration error (hydrate has been replaced with hydrateRoot in
React 18) itself,

> React expects that the rendered content is identical between the server and the client. It can patch up differences in text content, but you should treat mismatches as bugs and fix them. In development mode, React warns about mismatches during hydration. There are no guarantees that attribute differences will be patched up in case of mismatches. This is important for performance reasons because in most apps, mismatches are rare, and so validating all markup would be prohibitively expensive.

There were `examples` and `suggestions` as to **_how_** to **_fix_**
`invalid JSX` (`HTML`), but I **_still wanted_** to **_delve deeper_** before
**_making_** any **_changes_**. **_Honestly_**, I was **_wondering_** whether I
would **_be able_** to **_still use_** the `table element` with the **_nested_**
`Link` vs **_non-nested_** `Link`. It was **_terribly obvious_** `from` the
`beginning` that it **_just_** was **_not going_** to **_happen_**. I
**_looked_** for **_similar_** `issues/topics` on
[stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71706064/react-18-hydration-failed-because-the-initial-ui-does-not-match-what-was-render/74201575#74201575),
and the **_following_** is **_what_** I **_found_**:

I **_even found_** an `issue` on the `topic` on the `Next.js GitHub repository`.
There were **_many different solutions_** `proposed` there, but what **_did_**
`recur often` was the **_mention_** of `“invalid html”`.

And **_then_** I **_found another_** `issue` on the `Next.js Github repo`
**_entitled_**
[React 18 - Avoiding hydration errors, but initialize client-only state directly if possible #23068](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/23068).
But **_why_** would I **_want_** to **_keep_** `invalid HTML` **_just because_**
I am **_trying_** to **_force_** an `issue`? In **_this case_**, **_using_** a
`table` (which would **_not_** be `best practice` for `smaller viewports`,
because it just would **_not display_** like a `table` **_anymore anywway_**,
but **_more like_** a `single column` if **_even possible_**! `Tables` are
**_so_** `“1995”` **_anyway_**.

I **_refactored_** my `JSX` to **_finally_** look like **_something decent_**
and which was **_entirely responsive_** and a `mobile first design` (**_totally
into_** that **_approach now_**), and the **_following_** is the
` JSX`` I ***came up*** with for my  `Home` (`page`) `component`:

```jsx
export default function Home({ users }) {
	return (
		<section className={styles.container}>
			<article id="users">
				{users.map((user) => (
					<ul className="user-data" key={user.id}>
						<li>Name</li>
						<li>{user.name}</li>
						<li>Email</li>
						<li>{user.email}</li>
						<li>Details</li>
						<Link
							style={{ color: '#4caf50' }}
							href={`/users/${user.id}`}
						>
							View Details
						</Link>
					</ul>
				))}
			</article>
		</section>
	)
}
```

And the `getStaticProps` **_remained_** the **_same_**:

```jsx
export async function getStaticProps() {
	const res = await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users')

	const users = await res.json()

	return {
		props: {
			users,
		},
	}
}
```

And for the **_single_** `(dynamic) user` I **_ended up_** with the
**_following_** `JSX`:

```jsx
export default function Home({ user }) {
	return (
		<section className={styles.container}>
			<article id="users">
				<ul className="user-title">
					<li>Name</li>
					<li>Email</li>
					<li>Details</li>
				</ul>
				<ul key={user.id} className="user-data">
					<li>{user.name}</li>
					<li>{user.email}</li>
					<Link style={{ marginTop: '3rem' }} href="/">
						<b>Go Back</b>
					</Link>
				</ul>
			</article>
		</section>
	)
}
```

And **_there_**, I had **_both_** `getStaticProps` and `getStaticPaths`
**_because_** the `path` was **_dynamic_** (**_getting_** a `single user` by
`id`):

```jsx
export async function getStaticProps(context) {
	const res = await fetch(
		`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/${context.params.id}`,
	)

	const user = await res.json()

	return {
		props: {
			user,
		},
	}
}

export async function getStaticPaths() {
	const res = await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users')

	const users = await res.json()

	const ids = users.map((user) => user.id)
	const paths = ids.map((id) => ({ params: { id: id.toString() } }))

	// paths : { params: { id: '1', id: '2' } }

	return {
		paths,
		fallback: false,
	}
}
```

And **_both returned_** `JSX(s)` **_matched_** and were `valid HTML`. And this
is **_how_** the `Home page` **_rendered_**:

***Valid JSX***

It **_might not_** be a `table`, but it is `mobile first design`, and is
**_completely responsive_**. The **_entire repository_** on `Github`:

**_Happy Next.js JSX matching_**!
