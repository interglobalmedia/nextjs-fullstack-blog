I finally got a new `Windows` laptop. A `Dell Inspiron`, and I love it. It is
feeling more `Linux-like` than `Windows-like` (they are trying to emulate
`Linux` or `Unix` systems as much as much as possible within their limits). It
still is somewhat of a pain to work with, but I am also setting up `VirtualBox`
and a `Linux Distribution` (either Kali Linux or Ubuntu) so that I can have
access to a `Linux` environment. I have already set up `VSCode`, installed
`Git`, and added `Git Bash` to `VSCode` as the `integrated Terminal`. But of
course I can't use `Unix-like` or `Linux-like` commands. It still only receives
`Windows Command Prompt` commands. The only aspect that resembtes `Linux` or
`Unix` are the `Git` commands themselves. As for communication with `Github`, I
generated `SSH keys`, just as I have on my `macOS laptop`. It too was easy
peasy. An important note about that, however. Generate your `SSH keys` in the
`Command Prompt` and not in `VSCode`. `VSCode` complained that my `SSH` file
permissions were too open and would not save the key pair to my computer. But
when I tried to generate the key pair in `Command Prompt`, I had no issues.

## cd commandj

The `cd` command, aka changing directories, is the same in `Windows` as in
`Linux` and `Unix` (`macOS`). Let's say I was in the `home directory`
(`C:\Users\Owner\Desktop\development`), and I wanted to change into a folder
called `development` located on the `desktop`. I would run the following command
in `Command Prompt`:

```shell
cd desktop/development
```

And this would take me to:

```shell
C:\Users\Owner\Desktop\development
```

Notice how I created the `cd` command followed by the `path` I wanted to get to?
I used `/` instead of `\`, and it worked. That was not possible in `Windows 10`.
`Windows` is really trying to become more like `Linux` and `Unix` when it comes
to the `Terminal`. They even call the `Command Prompt` app the `Terminal` app.
At least that's the way it is on my `Dell Inspiron`!

If I want to go up one directory, I would run the following `cd` command:

```shell
cd ..
```

Or I could do the following if I were in a folder called `development` located
in the `desktop` directory (`\Users\Owner\Destkop\development`):

```shell
cd Users\Owner\Desktop
```

And it would take me to the `Desktop`.

## dir command

If I want to `list` the `contents` of a directory, I would run the `dir`
command. Let's say I am on the desktop (`C:\Users\Owner\Desktop`), and I run the
`dir` command:

```shell
dir
```

This is equivalent to the `ls` command in Unix, and the following would be
returned in `Terminal`:

```shell
07/09/2024  08:12 PM   <DIR>        .
07/09/10:32 10:32 PM   <DIR>        ..
07/09/2024  10:34 PM   <DIR>        development
07/09/2024  04:25 PM   <DIR>        kali-linux-install
03/02/2024  05:01 PM          2,350 Microsoft Edge.lnk
03/03/2024  07:45 PM          2,521 Nordpass.lnk
03/03/2024  08:22 PM          1,274 Norton Installation Files.lnk
03/02/2024  08:26 PM          1,933 Zoom.lnk
                4 File(s)     8,178 bytes
                4 Dir(s)  890,759,966,720 bytes free
```

## type nul command

Now let's say I wanted to create a file. This command differs greatly from Linux
or Unix. There, I would run the following:

```shell
touch file1.txt
```

The `touch` command followed by a `filename` creates a new file called
`file1.txt` in the `current directory`. In Windows, I run the following command:

```shell
type nul > file1.txt
```

This command creates a file called `file1.txt`. There are other ways of creating
a file in `Windows`, but I will cover that in a later post.

## del command

Now let's say I wanted to delete a file I had created called `file2.txt`. I
would run the following command in Command Prompt inside the directory where the
file is located:

```shell
# C:\Users\Owner\Desktop
del file2.txt
```

Then, to make sure that I did successfully `delete` the file `file2.txt`, I run
the `dir` command, and it's gone.

## rmdir command

Now let's say I want to `delete` an empty `folder`. I would run the following
command in Command Prompt from within the directory where the folder is located:

```shell
# C:\Users\Owner\Desktop
rmdir MyNewFolder
```

And when I run the `dir` command, `MyNewFolder` no longer exists.

## rmdir /s command

Now let's say I want to `delete` a `folder` that is not empty, and I run the
following command:

```shell
# C:\Users\Owner\Desktop
rmdir MyNewFolder
```

The folliowing is returned in `Command Prompt` (`Terminal`):

```shell
The directory is not empty.
```

And `MyNewFolder` is not deleted. However, if I run:

```shell
rmdir /s MyNewFolder
```

The following is returned in `Command Prompt`:

```shell
NewFolder, Are you sure (Y/N)?
```

Since I am the owner of this folder, I am able to delete it and its contents.
Since I do want to delete the folder, I type `Y`. Now when I run the `dir`
command, the folder is gone. `/s` deletes a directory tree (the specified
directory, in this case `MyNewFolder`, and all its `subdirectories`, including
all `files`).
