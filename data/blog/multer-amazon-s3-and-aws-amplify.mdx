So many of us that were first introduced to file and image uploads using
[Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/), a backend database, probably [Expressjs](https://expressjs.com/) and deploying to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/), for example, used the npm package [multer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/multer) to enable us to upload images locally via the client. We soon found out that that alone was not a viable solution on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/). We needed to supplement the [multer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/multer) npm package for local uploads with the [multer-s3](https://www.npmjs.com/package/multer-s3) npm package for
uploading images to [Amazon Simple Storage Service (aka S3)](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) for storing files on remote.

But it gets better. No one ever seems to mention, but only experience (by
checking), the fact that [multer-s3](https://www.npmjs.com/package/multer-s3), when configured to delete files, only deletes them locally. The remote file on **S3** remains.

One can upload and replace images, but the replaced images are not deleted on remote. I found that out the hard way when I had created a user authenticated blog using [multer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/multer),
[multer-s3](https://www.npmjs.com/package/multer-s3), [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/), [Expressjs](https://expressjs.com/) , and hosting it on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/). I verified the information by visiting the issues tab for [multer-s3](https://www.npmjs.com/package/multer-s3) on [Github](https://github.com/). In addition, If you read through the documentation very carefully, you will notice there is no reference to deleting files or images. Only uploads.

So I started a quest on how I could successfully implement multipart file
uploads (which is required) in which files and images could be uploaded on
**S3** AND deleted permanently via client interface as well. There is nothing worse than a platform that seems to delete a user's image when the user hits the delete button, but it only is deleted locally and on the client, but not on remote hosting. Not good for the user because they wanted it removed, and not good for the owner of the site who does not want to pay extra for unwanted files.

I think I may have just come across at least the **_beginning_** of my answer using **AWS Amplify**, **S3 storage** via **Amplify**, and **React** for the frontend. The post is entitled [GraphQL Tutorial - How to Manage Image & File Uploads & Downloads with AWS AppSync & AWS Amplify](https://dev.to/dabit3/graphql-tutorial-how-to-manage-image-file-uploads-downloads-with-aws-appsync-aws-amplify-hga) by **Nader Dabit**, **Twitter** handle [@dabit3](https://twitter.com/dabit3), **developer advocate** at **AWS Cloud**. It does **_not cover_** **dynamically deleting** a **file** from **_S3_**, but I do know that there is a way of doing so. The post I came across at least gets me started and bypasses the use of [multer-s3](https://www.npmjs.com/package/multer-s3), which is the root of my and many others' original problem.

When I went into the [Amplify docs](https://amplify.aws/community/) under the **Storage** section, there were sections on **PUT**, **GET**, and **REMOVE** requests for **_uploading_**, **_getting_**, and **_removing_** files. There are also **Amplify UI components** one can use with **React** or **Angular**, as well as a section on customizing the image upload path. To learn more, visit the [Amplify Javascript - Storage](https://aws-amplify.github.io/docs/js/storage) documentation. It will take more experimentation on my part to achieve this multipart dynamic file deletion goal on **AWS**. I am just in the beginning stages.

Then one has to beg the question, "If I am using **AWS Amplify** along with
**serverless**, and therefore also hosting there, perhaps I should look into
where using the **Amazon** native database [DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/) would work for my application as well instead of [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) (in such a use case)?" It might and might not be the right fit in every situation, but it is worth comparing the two.

Whichever platform one chooses to use, one has to weigh the pros and cons of it compared to other comparable platforms, and the pros should outweigh the cons. As I discussed with some people at a serverless event at the
[AWS Loft NYC](https://aws.amazon.com/start-ups/loft/ny-loft/) last night, no solution is perfect. The question is, "Which platform, given the compromises any may entail, will most encompass the **fulfillment** of one's **needs** and **budget**?".

The event I attended last night was a [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/) event entitled [Serverless with Gatsby and AWS AppSync + Serverless with Vue JS](https://www.meetup.com/JAMstack-nyc/events/261268213/)
at the [AWS Loft NYC](https://aws.amazon.com/start-ups/loft/ny-loft/). **Nader Dabit** spoke about [GatsbyJS](gatsbyjs.org/) and
[AWS AppSync](https://aws.amazon.com/appsync/), and **Divya Sasidharan**,
**Twitter handle** [@shortdiv](https://twitter.com/shortdiv) and **_developer advocate_** at [@Netlify](https://twitter.com/Netlify), spoke about **Serverless**, **Vuejs**, and hosting on [@Netlify](https://twitter.com/Netlify).
