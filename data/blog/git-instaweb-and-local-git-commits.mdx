***Git instaweb and local Git commits***

I **_recently_** came across `“git instaweb”`. I had **_never_** `heard` of it **_before_**, and **_wanted_** to **_learn more_** about it. I **_first
learned_** that it **_permits me_** to **_browse_** my `local repositories` on a `localhost` **_via_** something called `GitWeb`.

**_In order_** to **_be able_** to **_use_** `git instaweb` **_successfully_** on `macOS` (**_currently_** I am on `macOS Ventura`, and **_what_** I was **_on_** when **_trying_** to **_implement_** `git instaweb`), you **_have_** to **_have_** `lighttpd` **_installed_** as well. It **_can_** be **_installed_** `using` the `Homebrew` **_package manager_** for `macOS`, and **_luckily_**, I **_already had_** it **_installed_** and have **_installed_** `many` a `package` on my `MacBook Pro` **_via_** `Homebrew`.

But **_what_** IS `lighttpd`? It is

> A secure, fast compliant, and very flexible web server that has been optimized for high-performance environments. lighttpd uses memory and CPU efficiently and has lower resource use than other popular web servers. Its advanced feature-set (FastCGI, CGI, Auth, Output-Compression, URL-Rewriting and much more) make lighttpd the perfect web server for all systems, small and large. lighttpd is released under the Open Source revised BSD license. -
[the LIGHTTPD docs](https://www.lighttpd.net/)

**_In order_** to **_install_** `lighttpd` **_with_** `Homebrew`, **_run_** the **_command_** `brew install lighttpd`. **_Once_** you **_have_** it
**_installed_**, you **_will be able_** to **_successfully run_** the
`git instaweb` **_command_** in `Terminal` (or in **_my case_**, `iTerm2`). If you **_do not_** have `Homebrew` **_installed_** on your `Mac`, **_please
visit_** the [Homebrew website](https://brew.sh/) for **_installation
instructions_**.

`git instaweb` **_lets you_** `browse` your `working repository` in `GitWeb`. It is a **_simple_** `script/command` to **_set up_** `GitWeb` and a `web server` **_inside_** your `local repository` so that you can **_browse it_**. `GitWeb` is **_also known as_** `“Git on the Server”`, and it is a **_simple_** `web-based` **_visualizer_**. `Git` **_comes_** with this **_feature_**, and `GitWeb` is a `CGI` (`Common Gateway Interface`) `script` which **_enables_** `web-based visualization`.

A `CGI`, **_aka_**
[Common Gateway Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Gateway_Interface),

> is an interface specification that enables web servers to execute an external program, typically to process user requests. Such programs are often written in a scripting language and are commonly referred to as CGI scripts.
>
> A typical use case occurs when a web user submits a web form on a web page
> that uses CGI. The form’s data is sent to the web server within an HTTP
> request with a URL denoting a CGI script. The web server then launches the CGI script in a new computer process, passing the form data to it. This output of the CGI script, usually in the form of HTML, is returned by the script to the Web server, and the server relays it back to the browser as its response to the browser’s request.>Developed in the early 1990s, CGI was the earliest common method available that allowed a web page to be interactive. - [Common Gateway Interface on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Gateway_Interface)

We are **_not dealing_** with **_traditional_** `HTTP requests` in **_this_** `particular scenario` or `HTML forms`, but the `above information` **_still_** gives you an **_idea_** of **_what_** a `CGI script` is. And **_with_** the **_help_** of `git instaweb` and `lighttpd`, there are a **_number_** of **_options_**, **_including_** an `--httpd daemon command line` that **_can_** be **_executed_**.

And **_what_** does `daemon` **_mean_**? According to a thread entitled
`"Why should I create a daemon instead of a command line tool?"` on
[stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17491136/why-should-i-create-a-daemon-instead-of-a-command-line-tool),

> A daemon is typically a background process, so if you want your program to sit in the background and monitor something (e.g. report log file size increase every 5 minutes the last hour) and then report the results when someone watches a web page, a deamon is the correct choice.
>
> If you instead want to do something that can be done immediately (e.g. report current log file size), a command line tool is easier to create and maintain.

So **_that_** is **_why_** we **_would use_** a `daemon` **_which would_** be **_triggered_** by a `Git command` in the `Command Line Interface` (**_aka_** `Terminal`) on `macOS`.

**_This all_** is **_so fascinating_**, and I **_did not realize_** `until now` that we **_could surf_** our `local repositories` **_as if_** we **_were_** on a `remote server` **_such as_** `github.com`!

**_For example_**, if I **_go into_** my `local repository` **_called_**
`example-portfolio-site-github` and **_run_** the **_Git command_**
`git instaweb`, the **_following_** is **_returned_**:

```shell
2022-12-27 10:12:59: (network.c.540) can't bind to socket: 0.0.0.0:1234: Address already in use
Could not execute http daemon lighttpd -f.
```

**_However_**, if I **_run_** the **_Git command_** `git instaweb -p 4321`,
**_for example_**, **_defining_** a `specific port`, `4321` in **_this case_**, a `web browser instance` **_opens up_** in my **_default browser_**, and **_for me_**, my `example-portfolio-site-github` **_local repo_** `looked like` the **_following_**:

![Git instaweb](git-instaweb.webp)

***Git instaweb***

The **_above page_** `lists` the `remote branches` **_associated_** with the
`local repository` **_via_** `SSH`. There is a **_remote_** `main branch` and a **_remote_** `gh-pages branch` on `Github`.

If I **_click on_** the `“summary” link` to the **_right_** of `“Last Change”`, it **_looks like_** the **_following_**:

![Git instaweb summary](git-instwaweb-summary.webp)

***Git instaweb summary***

`“summary”` **_contains_** the `shortlog` of the **_latest commits_** I
**_made_** to the `local repository` under `“shortlog”`, and the
`local branches` **_associated_** with the `local repo` are **_listed under_** `“heads”`. **_That_** is **_because_** a `Git “head”` **_refers_** to the `branches` that `have been` **_checked out_** in the `history` of the
`local repository`. If I **_run_** the **_command_** `git branch`, **_which
lists_** `all` the `branches` **_associated_** with my `local repository`, in the **_case_** of **_this repository_**, I **_get back_** the **_following_**:

```shell
hamburger-icon-from-scratch
main
refactor-app-to-match-namecheap-version
```

And **_this_** `is what` it **_looks like_** in `VS Code`’s `Integrated Terminal`:

![Git branch](git-branch.webp)

`“remotes”` **_refers to_** the `remote repository` **_associated with_** the `local repository`. **_Here_**, `“origin”` is **_listed_**, and the `url` which is **_associated_** with `origin` on `Github`, is
`git@github.com:interglobalmedia/example-portfolio-site-github.git`. If I **_go into_** `this repository` on `Github`, and **_select_** the **_green_** `“Code” button`, I **_get_** the **_following_**:

![Github SSH repo url](github-ssh-repo-url.webp)

***Github SSH repo url***

**_Since_** I **_use_** `SSH` when **_pushing_** `local commits` to my
`remote origin branch` on `Github`, my `SSH url` is **_associated_** with my
`git push origin main` **_commands_**. **_How_** do I **_know that_**?
**_Because_** when I **_push_** my `first commit` to my `remote branch` on
`Github`, I **_run_** the **_Git command_** 

```shell
git remote add origin git@github.com:interglobalmedia/example-portfolio-site-github.git
``` 

This is the `git remote add origin` **_command_** I **_ran_** for **_this particular_** `local repository`, so that it `would become` **_associated with_** its `remote url` **_created_** by `Github` **_when_** I **_created_** the `remote repository` **_there_**.

**_When_** I **_actually pushed_** the `changes` to `remote origin` for the
**_first time_**, I **_ran_** the **_command_** 

```shell
git push -u origin main
```

**_What_** does the `-u` **_stand for_**? `-u` is short for `upstream remote`, and it is **_used_** to **_set_** `origin` as the `upstream remote` in your `git config`. So **_when_** you **_push_** your `local branch commits` with the `git push -u option`, **_that_** `local branch` is **_linked_** with the `remote branch` **_automatically_**. The **_advantage_** to this is that you **_may use_** `git pull` **_without_** any `arguments`. **_This means_** that you **_can run_** the `git pull command` **_without_** the **_need_** to **_add_** the `remote repository url` as an `argument`!

**_Happy GitWebbing!_**
