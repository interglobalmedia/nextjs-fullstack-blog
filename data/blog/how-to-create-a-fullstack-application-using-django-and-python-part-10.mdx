## Updating the UML class diagrams

I had mentioned that I `added` a `PostLike` class model to my `model schema`.
Now I am going to `share` the `UML Class Diagrams` to `include` the `PostLike`
model. This way, I can `determine` if `everything` truly is the `way` I `want`
it, or if I `have` to make further `changes`. I am also including the
`wireframe` reflecting the class diagram changes, which will even further
solidify if I have built exactly what I wanted to build thus far!

_UML class diagram including PostLike_

The `UML class diagram` including `PostLike` with a `focus` on `fields` now
`looks like` the `following`:

![UML class diagram fields including PostLike](uml_class_diagram_fields_including_postlike.drawio.svg)

_UML class diagram fields including PostLike_

To _re-review_ the `relations` between the `classes` (still the same here), you
can `refer` to the UML `Class Fields Diagram` under the `section heading`
[Comparing the UML Class Fields Diagram to the models.py source code](/blog/how-to-create-a-fullstack-application-using-django-and-python-part-7#comparing-the-uml-class-fields-diagram-to-the-modelspy-source-code)
in
[How to create a fullstack application using Django and Python Part 7](/blog/how-to-create-a-fullstack-application-using-django-and-python-part-7#comparing-the-uml-class-fields-diagram-to-the-modelspy-source-code).

There is _no_ `direct relationship` between the `user` and the `PostLike`. There
`isn't` even a `direct relationship` between the `Post` and `PostLike`, but the
`User` object is `passed` as an `argument` to `ManyToManyField()` [^1],
`because` the `user` is the one to `"like"` the `topic post`. We will `go over`
this in `detail later`. This `section` is about `updating` the `UML diagrams`
and `wireframe`(`s`) to `include` the `PostLike` model.

## Updating the boards wireframe(s)

Below is the `updated wireframe` including the `"post" likes` as well as a
`link button` to `copy` the `link` to the `post` so as to be able to `share` it
elsewhere:

wireframe_

## Clarifying the concepts of "topic" and "post"

The `concepts` of `"topic"` and `"post"` here may `seem` a bit `confusing`. It
was a bit `confusing` to `me` at `first`. Perhaps it was all in the naming. But
then I `studied` the actual `Django Forum`, and it `became clearer` to me. A
`topic` can be `regarded` as the `start` of a `board thread`, `like` on
`stackoverflow`, for example. A person `starts` a `topic`, which is the `name`
of the `thread`, and is `accompanied` by their _initial_ `"subject"` (post)
`regarding` the `topic`, and then others `reply` to that `subject` with their
own views on the `subject`. So the `posts` are really `replies` to the
`topic subject`.

## Conclusion

In this section, I updated the UML Class Diagrams and wireframe(s) to include
the PostLike Model, and I clarified the concepts of "topic" and "post".

## Footnotes

**[^1]**: The `ManyToManyField` set to `post_liked_by` in the `Post` class model
`describes` the `relationship` between the `User` and the `PostLike`, which is
`ManyToMany`. One `user` can like many `posts`, and one `post` can be liked by
many `users`.

The `PostLike` class model also has a `ManyToMany` relationship with the `Post`.
A `PostLike` instance `connects` a specific `user` to a specific `post` they
`liked`. This is `reflected` by the `ForeignKey` on the `post field` in the
`PostLike` model. Many thanks to @WarnerSmith on the
[Django Forum](https://forum.djangoproject.com) for clarifying `ManyToMany` for
me! To `view` his `response` there, please visit
[Warner Smith reply to my post topic "Trying to figure out what the relationship between my post topic and post like would be"](https://forum.djangoproject.com/t/trying-to-figure-out-what-the-relationship-between-my-post-topic-and-post-like-would-be/34614/4).
You do `have` to `join` the [Django Forum](https://forum.djangoproject.com) in
`order` to `view` it!
