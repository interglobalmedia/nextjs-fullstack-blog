In my article
[The pipe (|) and tee commands in Linux and Unix (macOS)](/blog/the-pipe-and-tee-commands-in-linux-and-unix-macos),
I talk about how one can save the `stdout` resulting from a command using `pipe`
(`|`) and `tee`. In this article, I discuss the `Linux` `script` command. The
`script` command `records` all `Terminal` activity.

## Running the (default) script command in Linux and Unix (macOS)

When I `run` the `script` command by typing `"script"` in `Terminal` followed by
the `Return` (`Enter`) key, the following is returned in `Terminal` in both
`Linux` and `Unix` (`macOS`):

```shell
Script started, output log file is 'typescript'
```

And if I run `ls` on the home directory (`~`), the `typescript` file appears in
my `current working directory`. When I `run` the `script` command `without` any
`args`, a `file` called `typescript` is `automatically created` by `default`.
This file `saves` all `Terminal` related `activity` information in the
**_current_** `Terminal` session.

For example, if I open up the `typescript` file with the `vim` command in
`Linux`, it looks something like the following:

```shell
Script started on 2024-07-14 19:29:11-04:00 {TERM="xterm-256color" TTY="dev/pts/2" COLUMNS="80" LINES="24"]

                                        1872,643-553  Bot
```

It is a long file, and I was not able to export the `typescript` file from
`Linux Mint` in `VirtualBox` into `Windows 11`. If anyone knows of a way of
doing that, let me know! I tried to `install` a an `email server package`, but
couldn't get beyond the `configuration` step. I couldn't `configure` it in
`Terminal` and couldn't `exit` the `package configuration` either.

It is basically the `same process` to `start` the `script` command in `Unix`
(`macOS`),

Let's say I just run the `script` command without any `args` from inside
`mariadcampbell.com`'s `local repository` directory:

```shell
script
```

This resulted in the following:

```shell
mariacam@Marias-MBP î‚° ~/Development/nextjs-and-react-complete-guide/fullstack-blog î‚° î‚  main î‚° script

Script started, output file is typescript
```

And a `file` called `"typescript"` was `created` inside this `directory`:

```shell
ls

# the following was returned:

If I wanted to find out `how many` **_lines_** `typescript` contains, I ran the
following command:

```shell
wc -l typescript
```

which returns:

```shell
24 typescript
```

This means that the `file` contains `24 lines`. And if I run the `exit` command,
the following is returned:

```shell
Script done, output file is typescript
```

And if I then run `wc -l typescript` again, it returns the following:

```shell
28 typescript
```

That is because the `exit` command is `appended` to the `end` of the
`typescript` file.

## Running custom scripts in Unix (macOS)

Now let's say I want to do things a bit differently, follow a `different script`
(other than `script` itself) inside my `fullstack-blog` directory which houses
the `local repo` for `mariadcampbell.com`:

```shell
npm run dev 2>&1 | tee ~/desktop/full-stack-blog.txt
```

`Instead` of `using` the `script` command, I am using a `"custom script"`. In
fact, it is an `npm local script` **_located_** in my `package.json` file for
`mariadcampbell.com`. The `following` then is `returned` in `Terminal`:

```shell
 fullstack-blog@0.1.0 dev
> next dev

  â–² Next.js 14.2.4
  - Local:        http://localhost:3000
  - Environments: .env.development.local, .env.local, .env

 âœ“ Starting...
 âœ“ Ready in 1241ms
```

The `custom script` resulted in **_first running_** the `npm run dev` command
and `starting up` the `development server` for `fullstack-blog` in the
`browser`, and the `stdout` to `Terminal` is the following above. But since I
**_also use_** pipe `|` and `tee`, it `resulted` in the `creation` of a `file`
called `fullstack-blog.txt` on the `desktop`, and it `contained` the
`following`:

```shell

> fullstack-blog@0.1.0 dev
> next dev

  â–² Next.js 14.2.4
  - Local:        http://localhost:3000
  - Environments: .env.development.local, .env.local, .env

 âœ“ Starting...
 âœ“ Ready in 1241ms

```

which is the `same` as `stdout` to `Terminal`!

In addition, I am `redirecting` any `errors` that may occur to
`fullstack-blog.txt` as well. `2` points to `stderr`. `1` points to `stdout`.
And `2>&1` redirects `npm run dev` `stdout` and `stderr` to
`fullstack-blog.txt`. **_Specifically_**, `2>&1` means `redirect` `stderr` to
`stdout`, and `both` are `stdin` for the `tee` command, which basically `copies`
and `pastes` `stdout` to a `specified file`. In this case, `fullstack-blog.txt`.

Let's say I wanted to **_stop_** `npm run dev`, thereby `stop redirecting` it to
the `fullstack-blog.txt` file. I simply press the `Control key` + `C key` like I
would `normally` when I want to `stop running` the `development server`. But if
I simply ran `npm run dev` afterwards, the `stdout` to `Terminal` would no
longer be `redirected` to `fullstack-blog.txt`. I would `have` to **re-run**
`npm run dev 2>&1 | tee ~/desktop/full-stack-blog.txt`. And if I want to
`append` new `stdout` to the `end` of the `file` instead of `overwriting` it,
the `default behavior` of the `tee` command, I would `run` the `following`
**_instead_**:

```shell
npm run dev 2>&1 | tee -a ~/desktop/full-stack-blog.txt
```

And now the `stdout` of `fullstack-blog.txt` is the following:

```shell
> fullstack-blog@0.1.0 dev
> next dev

  â–² Next.js 14.2.4
  - Local:        http://localhost:3000
  - Environments: .env.development.local, .env.local, .env

 âœ“ Starting...
 âœ“ Ready in 1241ms

> fullstack-blog@0.1.0 dev
> next dev

  â–² Next.js 14.2.4
  - Local:        http://localhost:3000
  - Environments: .env.development.local, .env.local, .env

 âœ“ Starting...
 âœ“ Ready in 1154ms
```

The `same` can be `done` with any `script` that you want to `save` to a `file`.
**_This way_**, if you want to be able to refer back to the
`logging information` and find out `what` went `wrong`, **_for example_**, or
perhaps `what` went `right`, you could `refer` to the `.txt` file that the
`stdout` was `redirected` to, `written` to, and `saved`. For
`nextjs developers`, **_for example_**, or `developers` in `general`, doing this
with the `build script`, the `production server` **_post-build_**, the
`test script`, any `linting scripts`, etc., is very useful.

If I `make` my `way around` my `nextjs application` in the `browser`, this is
`logged` as well. I visited a couple of pages and posts, and since I was using
the `-a` or `--append` flag, the `new stdout` was `added` to the `end` of the
`fullstack-blog.txt` file:

```shell
> fullstack-blog@0.1.0 dev
> next dev

  â–² Next.js 14.2.4
  - Local:        http://localhost:3000
  - Environments: .env.development.local, .env.local, .env

This is `much longer` than the `previous stdout` I shared here!
