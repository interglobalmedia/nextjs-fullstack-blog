## What is the history command?

The `history` command in `Linux` (and `macOS`) stores a `list` of `commands`
that have been `used` in `Terminal` sessions, `and` it `permits` us to `reuse`
them `instead` of `retyping` them.

## history is not actually a command

If I run `which history` in `Terminal`, `nothing` is `stdout`. This `confirms`
that `history` is `not` actually a `command`. `history` is a `built-in` keyword
of our `shell` (Another example is the `cd` command. It `also` is a `builtin`
keyword and `not` a `command`). And because `history` is `written` into the
`particular shell` we are `using` at `any` given `time`, there can be a
`difference` in its `behavior` across `shells`. But since I use `bash` in
`Linux`, I will be discussing `bash-specific` history `behavior` in my
`particular` Linux `distro` (`Linux Mint`).

## history

If I run `history` in `Terminal`, I get back `428` lines, `each line` containing
a `command` I have `run` in `Terminal`. The `following` is a `sneak peak` at
`history` stdout:'

```shell
  1 ls
  2 cd Desktop
  3 ls
  4 cd cron-job-scripts/
  5 ls
  6 mailx
  7 sudo apt update
  8 sudo apt upgrade
  9 sudo apt install mailx
  ...
428 history
```

If I `wanted` to `run` a `specific command` using its `line number`, I would
`run` the `following`:

```shell
!84
```

Which would `return` the `following`:

```shell
cd desktop-backup/
```

This is the `command` at `line 84` in (`Terminal`) `history`. I `could` also
`access` and `run` this `command` by `running` the `following`:

```shell
!cd desktop-backup/
```

`Sometimes`, `as` in `this case`, we `get` back `something like` the
`following`:

```shell
cd desktop-backup/ desktop-backup/
bash cd: too many arguments
```

So I `tried` another `one` that does `not` result in any `ambiguity`:

```shell
!clear
```

It `runs` the `clear command`, `clearing` the `Terminal` window. Using `!`
before the `command itself` prompts `history` to `search` for the `last command`
that `matches` the `pattern` I `provided`. `In` this `case`, it is `clear`.

But I digress. Let's get to the task at hand.

## Removing history

There are `several ways` to `remove` some or all `commands` saved to `history`.

### Deleting a command by line number

If I `want` to `delete` a `command` saved to `history` by `line number`, I would
`run` the `following command`:

```shell
history -d 423
```

This `removes` the `command` at line `423`. This is a `great command` to `know`
in `case` if you have `mistyped` a `command`, for example, and `want` to
`remove` it from `history` because it is essentially `useless`. But it can
`also` be `used` to `remove` specific `commands` containing
`sensitive information`. Why? `What` if` you` had to use `history` or
`some other` related `tool` or `command` in a `presentation`, and you `wanted`
to `make sure` that `nothing sensitive` would `appear` on the `screen`, and you
`didn't want` to `completely remove` your `history`. This `would` be `one way`
to `do that`.

### history -c

The `history -c` command `removes` the `contents` of a specific `Terminal`
session's `history`. If I run `history -c` and then `check` to `see` if the
`contents` of my `Terminal` session's `history` was `indeed` completely
`removed`, I would run `history` again, and `something like` the `following`
would be `returned`:

```shell
1 history
```

### Manually removing the contents of .bash_history

`history` stores the `commands` run in `Terminal` in a `file` called
`.bash_history`, which is `located` in a `user`'s home `directory`. If, after
running `history -c`, I `want` to `double check` if `all` my `history` has
actually `been removed`, I can run `vim .bash_history` to `open up` the `file`
in `Vim`. And `something like` the `following` would `appear`:

```shell
# The contents of .bash_history contained 426 lines. I am truncating it.
...
which diff
diff -s secret_message.txt decrypted_super_secret.txt
sha512sum secret_message.txt
```

`history -c` only `clears` the `history` of a `specific` Terminal `session`, but
`not` the `entire contents` of `.bash_history` itself. Some articles state that
it `completely removes` all your `history`, but `it` does `not`. After running
`history -c`, your `.bash_history` still `contains` the `history` of the
`commands` you `have run` in `Terminal`.

If I `wanted` to `manually remove` the `contents` of `.bash_history`, I would
`have` to `open` the `file` and `manually delete` the `contents` of the `file`.
I could `open` the `file` using `open .bash_history` inside my `home directory`
where the `file resides`, `Control + A` the `file contents`, and then `hit` the
`delete` key and `remove` the `file contents`.

I could `also` run `vim .bash_history` and be `taken` into the `Vim interface`.
There, I would `do` the `following`:

```shell
# First I go into Vim normal mode by hitting the `esc` key
# Next, I enter command mode by hitting Shift key + : (colon)
# To Select All, I hit the Shift Key + % (5 key) after the colon (:)
# to delete everything, I then hit the D key after %
# To save my changes, I hit the esc key followed by Shift key + : (colon) and then the X key. This saves my changes and takes me out of Vim.
```

`If`, `after deleting` the `entire contents` of `.bash_history`,
`subsequent commands` are `not saved` to `.bash_history` (it remains empty),
`run` the `following command`:

```shell
history > .bash_history
```

Then `open` up `.bash_history`, and you `should see` your stored `Terminal`
history `reappear`. That is `because` you `have` redirected `history` as
`stdout` to the `.bash_history` file.

`Next`, to doubly `make sure` that `everything` is `working` as it `should`,
`run` a `few commands` in `Terminal`, and `then` re-open `.bash_history` to
`see` if those `commands` are `being saved` to `.bash_history`. `When` I
`did this` and re-opened `.bash_history`, I `saw` that `new commands` were `not`
being `added` to `.bash_history`. `Even when` I quit `Terminal` and `started` a
`new session`. So I `had` to `do` the `following` to `do` a `history` "reset":

```shell
# I ran this inside my home directory /home/maria where my .bash_history resides
rm .bash_history
touch .bash_history
```

`Once` I re-created the `.bash_history` file, I `saw` that `Terminal history`
was `saved` to `.bash_history`, but `commands` from a `Terminal` session would
`save` to the `.bash_history` file `when` I would `exit` out of a `Terminal`
session and `start` a `new one`. `But` it `worked` just `fine` and as
`expected`!

### Clearing .bash_history using the echo command

`In order` to `remove` to `complete contents` of the `~/.bash_history` file, I
`ran` the `following command`:

```shell
# I did not have to add ~/ in front of .bash_history because I ran the command inside my home directory
echo > .bash_history
```

And `when` I `opened` up `.bash_history` using `open .bash_history`, the `file`
was `completely empty`. This is the `ONLY command` that `successfully removed`
the `contents` of my `.bash_history` file!

## bash history, privacy and security

`Clearing` one's `bash history` is not `just about` keeping things `"clean"`.
it's `also` about `safeguarding` one's `privacy` and `security`. By `clearing`
our `bash history` on a `regular basis`, we can `help` protect
`sensitive information` that `we` may have `used` in a `command`, `such` as
`passwords` or other `confidential data`.
