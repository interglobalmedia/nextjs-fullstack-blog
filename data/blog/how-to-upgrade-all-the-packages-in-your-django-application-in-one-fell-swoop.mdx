## How to upgrade all the packages in your Django application in one fell swoop

I was just working on a `Django` application, and one of my `djLint`
dependencies was not up to date. It `resulted` in the following `error` when I
ran the `pip install -r requirements.txt` command:

```shell
ERROR: pip's dependency resolver does not currently take into account all the packages that are installed. This behaviour is the source of the following dependency conflicts.
djlint 1.36.4 requires click>=8.0.1, but you have click 7.1.2 which is incompatible.
djlint 1.36.4 requires pyyaml>=6, but you have pyyaml 5.3.1 which is incompatible.
djlint 1.36.4 requires tqdm>=4.62.2, but you have tqdm 4.47.0 which is incompatible.
sphinx 8.1.3 requires Jinja2>=3.1, but you have jinja2 2.11.2 which is incompatible.
```

I `ran` the command `pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt` to `find out`
what `version upgrade` I `needed` for the `click` package. The `following` was
`returned` in `Terminal`:

```shell
ERROR: Cannot install -r requirements.txt (line 3), click==7.1.2 and djlint==1.36.4 because these package versions have conflicting dependencies.

The conflict is caused by:
    The user requested click==7.1.2
    djlint 1.36.4 depends on click>=8.0.1
    The user requested click==7.1.2
    djlint 1.36.4 depends on click>=8.0.1

To fix this you could try to:
1. loosen the range of package versions you've specified
2. remove package versions to allow pip to attempt to solve the dependency conflict

ERROR: ResolutionImpossible: for help visit https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/topics/dependency-resolution/#dealing-with-dependency-conflicts
```

I replaced `7.1.2` with `8.0.1` in `requirements.txt`. I could have `upgraded`
to the `latest version` of `click` by `running` the `following`:

```shell
pip install --upgrade click
```

This time, the following version was installed:

```shell
Requirement already satisfied: click in /Users/mariacam/.pyenv/versions/3.13.0/lib/python3.13/site-packages (8.0.1)
Collecting click
  Using cached click-8.1.8-py3-none-any.whl.metadata (2.3 kB)
Using cached click-8.1.8-py3-none-any.whl (98 kB)
Installing collected packages: click
  Attempting uninstall: click
    Found existing installation: click 8.0.1
    Uninstalling click-8.0.1:
      Successfully uninstalled click-8.0.1
Successfully installed click-8.1.8
```

I replaced `8.0.1` with `8.1.8`. Then I ran
`pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt` again.

`After` I had `fixed` the `click` issue, and ran
`pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt`, the `following` was `returned`:

```shell
ERROR: Cannot install -r requirements.txt (line 3), PyYAML==5.3.1 and djlint==1.36.4 because these package versions have conflicting dependencies.

The conflict is caused by:
    The user requested PyYAML==5.3.1
    djlint 1.36.4 depends on pyyaml>=6
    The user requested PyYAML==5.3.1
    djlint 1.36.4 depends on pyyaml>=6

To fix this you could try to:
1. loosen the range of package versions you've specified
2. remove package versions to allow pip to attempt to solve the dependency conflict

ERROR: ResolutionImpossible: for help visit https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/topics/dependency-resolution/#dealing-with-dependency-conflicts
```

Again, I upgraded `PYAML` by running `pip install --upgrade PyYAML`, and the
`following` was `returned`:

```shell
Requirement already satisfied: PyYAML in /Users/mariacam/.pyenv/versions/3.13.0/lib/python3.13/site-packages (6.0.2)
```

I replaced `5.3.1` with `6.0.2` in `requirements.txt`, and `then` ran
`pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt` again. The `following` was
`returned`:

```shell
ERROR: Cannot install -r requirements.txt (line 3), djlint==1.36.4 and tqdm==4.47.0 because these package versions have conflicting dependencies.

The conflict is caused by:
    The user requested tqdm==4.47.0
    djlint 1.36.4 depends on tqdm>=4.62.2
    The user requested tqdm==4.47.0
    djlint 1.36.4 depends on tqdm>=4.62.2

To fix this you could try to:
1. loosen the range of package versions you've specified
2. remove package versions to allow pip to attempt to solve the dependency conflict

ERROR: ResolutionImpossible: for help visit https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/topics/dependency-resolution/#dealing-with-dependency-conflicts
```

I upgraded `tqdm` by running `pip install --upgrade tqdm`, and the `following`
was `returned`:

```shell
Requirement already satisfied: tqdm in /Users/mariacam/.pyenv/versions/3.13.0/lib/python3.13/site-packages (4.67.1)
```

I replaced `4.62.2` with `4.67.1` in `requirements.txt`, and ran
`pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt` again. This time `no` version
`conflicts` were returned:

```shell

## Conclusion

I `technically` was `not able` to `upgrade` all `packages` in my
`requirements.txt` file in `"one fell swoop"` (it is not possible), but I
`did get` the `information` I `needed` in `"one fell swoop at a time"`. The
`pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt` command `informed me` what
`dependency` conflicts `existed` in my `requirements.txt` file by `returning` an
`ERROR: ResolutionImpossible` error, and the
`pip install --upgrade <packagename>` command `updated` an `individual package`
to its `latest version`.
