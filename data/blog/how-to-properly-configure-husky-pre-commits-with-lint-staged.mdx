Recently I updated the husky pre-commit hook I use in my JavaScript workflows,
including React and Next.js. Why? Because the way I had it set up, linting was
happening AFTER I git committed my files, and not before. So that meant that a
lot of code was output to Terminal before reaching the git commmit message in
VIM.

Originally, I had the following in my husky pre-commit file:

```shell
#!/usr/bin/env sh
. "$(dirname -- "$0")/_/husky.sh"

npm run validate
```

And I had the following scripts in `package.json`:

```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "next dev",
  "build": "next build && node ./scripts/generate-sitemap",
  "start": "next start",
  "analyze": "cross-env ANALYZE=true next build",
  "svg": "svgr -d components/social-icons components/social-icons/svgs",
  "svg:share": "svgr -d components/social-share-icons components/social-share-icons/svgs",
  "export": "next export",
  "lint": "next lint",
  "stylelint": "stylelint styles/**/*.scss",
  "stylelint:fix": "stylelint --fix **/*.scss",
  "prettier": "prettier \"**/*.+(js|jsx|json|yml|yaml|css|less|scss|ts|tsx|md|graphql|mdx)\"",
  "validate": "npm run lint && npm run stylelint && npm run prettier",
  "prepare": "husky install"
},
```

The top level script used in the pre-commit file was `validate`, and it ran the
`lint`, `stylelint`, and `prettier` scripts. So linting took place AFTER
`git commit` a file. And I did not want to do that! It wasted a lot of time and
looked messy!

This meant that I both had to reconfigure lint-staged and change the script I
added to the husky pre-commit file. Originally, I had the following lint-staged
related json in my package.json file:

```json
"lint-staged": {
  "*.+(js|jsx|ts|tsx)": [
    "eslint --fix"
  ],
  "*.+(js|jsx|ts|tsx|json|css|md|mdx)": [
    "prettier --write"
  ]
}
```

I wanted to separate concerns as much as possible, so I decided to move the
lint-staged related code into a file called `.linststagedrc.json`. And it looks
like the following:

```json
{
	"*.+(js|jsx|ts|tsx)": ["eslint --fix", "jest --findRelatedTests"],
	"*.+(js|jsx|ts|tsx|json|css|md|mdx)": ["prettier --write"],
	"styles/**/*.scss": ["stylelint --fix"]
}
```

I added scripts for `eslint`, `prettier` and `stylelint`. I also added a `jest`
script because I had created some `tests`.

Last, but not least, I changed the script in the husky pre-commit hook. The
content of the file looks like the following:

```shell
#!/usr/bin/env sh
. "$(dirname -- "$0")/_/husky.sh"

npx lint-staged
```

And my scripts in package.json looks like the following:

```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "next dev",
  "dev-secure": "next dev --experimental-https",
  "build": "next build && node ./scripts/generate-sitemap",
  "start": "next start",
  "analyze": "cross-env ANALYZE=true next build",
  "svg": "svgr -d components/social-icons components/social-icons/svgs",
  "svg:share": "svgr -d components/social-share-icons components/social-share-icons/svgs",
  "export": "next export",
  "lint": "next lint",
  "stylelint": "stylelint styles/**/*.scss",
  "stylelint:fix": "stylelint --fix **/*.scss",
  "prettier": "prettier \"**/*.+(js|jsx|json|yml|yaml|css|less|scss|ts|tsx|md|graphql|mdx)\"",
  "prepare": "husky install",
  "test": "jest --coverage"
},
```

Now, when I run the latest version of `lint-staged` with `npx` (without actually
having to permanently install it), it in turn runs the `eslint`, `stylelint`,
`prettier`, and `jest` scripts located in `.lintstagedrc.json`. And that is it!
