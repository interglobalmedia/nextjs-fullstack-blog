    'How to measure test coverage in Django. In this post, I go over the basics
    of Coverage.py and how to determine how much of a Django application my
    tests have covered using the coverage command. There is much more to
    Coverage.py, and more Command Line usage available, but this is a great
    start.'

## What is test coverage in Django?

When we have `written` some `tests` for our `Django` applications, we
`might wonder` whether or `not` we `wrote` enough `tests` and `for` the
`right things`. `One way` we can `determine` this is by `measuring` the
`coverage` of our `tests`. In other words, `how thoroughly` our `tests`
encompass our `application`'s `code`.

## Tools for measuring coverage in Django

Probably the most `popular tool` _for measuring_ `coverage` in `Python` is the
[Coverage.py](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/7.6.1/) tool. It _monitors_
`Python` programming, noting `which parts` of the `code` have been `executed`,
then `analyzes` the `source` _to identify_ `code` that `could have` been
`executed` _but was_ `not`.

## Installing Coverage.py

To install `coverage.py`, `run` the `command` below in the `root directory` of
your `project` (in my case, the `django-boards` directory (as opposed to
`django_boards` directory)) where the `venv` directory `resides`. Also make sure
that your `virtual environment` has been `activated` _before_ `installing` the
`coverage` package.

```shell
python3 -m pip install coverage
```

## The C extension

According to
[Coverage.py](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html),

> Coverage.py includes a C extension for speed. It is strongly recommended to
> use this extension: it is much faster, and is needed to support a number of
> coverage.py features. Most of the time, the C extension will be installed
> without any special action on your part.

## Checking for coverage's version

In order to `find out` what `version` of `coverage` we have `installed`, we can
`run` the `following command` in `Terminal` inside our `Django project` with
`venv` _activated_:

```shell
coverage --version
```

When I ran `coverage --version` at the `django-boards` _root directory_, I
`got back` the `following`:

```shell
Coverage.py, version 7.6.1 with C extension
Full documentation is at https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/7.6.1
```

My `coverage` _installation_ does `come` with the `C extension`.

## Running the coverage command

In order to _implement_ `Coverage.py`, we `run` the `following command` in the
`directory` where our `manage.py` file `resides`:

```shell
coverage run manage.py test
```

This `command` _will include_ ALL our `project` tests: _both_ in `accounts` and
`boards`.

## Coverage report

_After running_ `coverage run manage.py test`, we can `generate` a
`coverage report` with the `following command` in the _same directory_:

```shell
coverage report
```

_For me_, the `following report` was _generated_:

| Name                                                                           | Stmts   | Miss  | Cover   |

## Coverage html

If I `want` to `generate` an `html document` of my `coverage report` (`produce`
annotated `HTML` listings with `coverage` results), I _can run_ `coverage html`
in `Terminal`, and the `following` is `returned`:

```shell
Wrote HTML report to htmlcov/index.html
```

I `add` the `htmlcov` directory to my `.gitignore` file, and I also `add` the
`.coverage` file that was `created` when I ran `coverage run manage.py test`.

## Conclusion

In this post, I went over the `basics` of `Coverage.py` and `how` to `determine`
the `percentage` of a `Django` application my `tests` have `covered` using the
`coverage` command. There is _much more_ to `Coverage.py`, and more
`Command Line` usage `available`, but _this_ is a _great start_.
