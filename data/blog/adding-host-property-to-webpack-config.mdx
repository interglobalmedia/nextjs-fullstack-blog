**_Note_**: this assumes your `operating system` is `Unix` (`OSX`) and that your **_computer_** is a `Mac`.

Did you know that if you **_added_** the `host` **_property_** to your
`devServer` **object** in your `webpack.config.js` file, it **_enables_** you to view your app via `localhost` on **_other devices_** that **share** the **_same network_** as your `computer`? i.e., your **_smart phone_** or **_tablet_**?

**_First_**, add the `host` **property** to your `devServer {}` **_object_** in your `webpack.config.js` file with the **_following_** `value`:

```js
host: '0.0.0.0'
```

**_Next_**, **re-start** the `webpack-dev-server` with your `webpack-dev-server` **_script_**. Mine is `npm run dev`.

When you **_know_** that your `webpack-dev-server` has **started up**
**_successfully_**, **_type_** the following `command` in `Terminal` to find out the **_local_** `IP address` of your **Mac** `computer/laptop`:

```shell
ipconfig getifaddr en0
```

You can **_also_** find out your computer's **local** `IP address` by **_going
into_** `Preferences` -> `Network`, and towards the **_top right_** of the
`Network` **window**, **_below_** `Status: Connected`, you will find something
like the **_following_**:

```shell
Wi-Fi is Connected to xxxxxxxxxxx-5G and has the IP address 192.168.x.x
```

Then **_go into_** another **device**, like your `smart phone`, for example,
which is **_running_** on the **same network**, and type in the **_following_**:

```shell
192.168.x.x:port
```

`port` should be **_replaced_** by the `port number` you **_use_** in your
`webpack.config.js` file. It is the `value` you **_pass_** to the `port`
**property** **_within_** your `devServer` **object**:

```js
devServer:{
    before:function(app,server){
        server._watch('./app/**/*.html')
    },
    contentBase:path.join(__dirname,'app'),
    hot:true,
    port:3000,
    host:'0.0.0.0'
},
```

And you should see the **_mobile version_** of your **application** rendered
**_there_**!

I will be embedding this episode of **Plugging in The Holes** along with a
**_transcript_** in the form of a **post** on
[interglobalmedianetwork.com](https://www.interglobalmedianetwork.com/) for your **_hearing_** and **_reading_** pleasure. Bye for now!
