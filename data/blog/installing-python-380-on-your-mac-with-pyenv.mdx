Recently I wrote a post entitled [Installing the latest version of Python on Mac OS Catalina and overriding the old default pre-installed version](https://www.interglobalmedianetwork.com/blog/2020-05-29-installing-the-latest-version-of-python-on-mac-os-catalina-and-overriding-the-old-default-pre-installed-version/)
about _**installing**_ `Python 3.7.7` on Mac OS Catalina with `Homebrew`.
`Python 3.7.7` was the latest version of Python that one could install < 3.8.0. At the time, I was totally okay with that. That was before I discovered the
`Mkdocs` documentation generator, which requires Python 3.8.2. It also supports 3.8.3. I checked to make sure!

`Python 3.8.0+` requires a _**different path**_ than `Python 3 < 3.8.0` on
`Mac OS Catalina`. I _**installed**_ `Python 3.7.7` using `Homebrew`, and you
can _**compare**_ the **differences** in the _**installation processes**_ by
**reading** _**both**_ [Installing the latest version of Python on Mac OS Catalina and overriding the old default pre-installed version](https://www.interglobalmedianetwork.com/blog/2020-05-29-installing-the-latest-version-of-python-on-mac-os-catalina-and-overriding-the-old-default-pre-installed-version/) and _**this post**_.

After a couple of failed attempts, I finally found the _**best way**_ to
**install** `Python 3.8.0+` on my computer and make `Python 3.8.3` the **global version** of **Python**. I ended up **installing** `pyenv`, the `Python` **version manager**, on my computer using `Homebrew`, and then
_**configuring**_`the correct path` to `Python 3.8.3` in my `.zshrc` file
_**located**_ in my **home directory**. I could not afford to _**wait around**_ for `Homebrew` to _**support**_ `3.8.0+`, and `pyenv` is a **great solution** in **general**! It is **_akin to_** `nvm`, the Nodejs **version manager**. The concept is the same, and both made installing `Nodejs` and `Python` **easy** on `Mac OS Catalina`!

This post _**assumes**_ that you have `Homebrew` _**installed**_ on your
`Mac computer` with `OS Catalina` _**installed**_ as well.

First I ran `brew update`, to _**update**_ `Homebrew`. One should always run
that command _**before**_ installing something **new** with `Homebrew`.

Then I ran `brew install pyenv`. That installed the Python version manager
`pyenv`.

Then I had to _**add**_ the `pyenv` **path** to my **zsh profile**, `.zshrc`,
_**located**_ in my **home directory**.

```shell
echo 'export PATH="$(pyenv root)/shims:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
```

This command _**copied**_ the command `export PATH="$(pyenv root)/shims:$PATH"` to my `.zshrc` file. The _**following**_ was **added** to the _**bottom**_ of `.zshrc`:

```shell
export PATH="$(pyenv root):$PATH"
```

Next, I wanted to _**check**_ what `Python` **versions** are available through
`pyenv`, so I could _**execute**_ the following command in `Terminal`:

```shell
pyenv install --list
```

A long list of things were returned, but I will only list what versions of the
`Real Python` were available to me (6.28.20) at the time of writing this post:

  3.6.5
  3.6.6
  3.6.7
  3.6.8
  3.6.9
  3.6.10
  3.6.11
  3.7.0
  3.7-dev
  3.7.1
  3.7.2
  3.7.3
  3.7.4
  3.7.5
  3.7.6
  3.7.7
  3.7.8
  3.8.0
  3.8-dev
  3.8.1
  3.8.2
  3.8.3
  3.9.0b3
  3.9-dev
  3.10-dev
```

And after I installed the Python versions I wanted, I ran the following command to see what versions were installed on my computer via `pyenv`:

```shell
pyenv versions
```

For me, it returned:

```shell
system
3.8.2
* 3.8.3 (set by /Users/mariacam/.pyenv/version)
```

The **system version** is the `Mac OS` **system version** (`2.7.14`) which is
_**included**_ with `pyenv` as well, and `3.8.2` and `3.8.3` were
**_installed_** by **me**.

Then I had to _**set**_ a `global` **version** for my computer, so I
_**executed**_ the following command:

```shell
pyenv global 3.8.3
```

When I ran the command

```shell
python --version
```

the following was returned:

```shell
Python 3.8.3
```

And it worked!

If you _**want**_ to use a **different version** of `Python` using `pyenv` in a _**particular project**_, you would **run** the _**following command**_:

```shell
pyenv local 3.8.2
```

for example. Just _**change**_ the `Python` **version number** to the one _**you want**_. You just have to **make sure** you _**already**_ have it **installed** on your computer via `pyenv`.

Now my `Mkdocs` documentation generator works perfectly. I just had to _**make
sure**_ that I **updated** `pip` to the _**latest version**_ before everything
worked smoothly. I _**got**_ the **version** I _**needed**_ for `Mkdocs` support via their website, and then **updated** `pip` with the following command:

```shell
pip install --upgrade pip
```

`pip` comes with `Python`, but you _**may**_ want to just **upgrade** to the
_**latest version**_. That is what I did, because I did not have the later
version that was required for `Mkdocs`, so I upgraded `pip`.
