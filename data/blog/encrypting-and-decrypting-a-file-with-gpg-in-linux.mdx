## What is GPG?

`According` to `man gpg` in `Linux`,

> `GPG` is an` OpenPGP encryption` and `signing` tool `native` to `Linux`. The
> `gpg` command is the `OpenPGP` part of the `GNU Privacy Guard` (`GnuPG`). It
> is a tool that `provides` digital `encryption` and `signing services` using
> the `OpenPGP` standard. `gpg` features complete key `management` and `all` the
> `bells` and `whistles` you would `expect` from a full
> `OpenPGP implementation`.
>
> There are `two` main `versions` of `GnuPG`: `GnuPG 1.x` and `GnuPG 2.x`.
> `GnuPG 2.x` supports `modern` encryption `algorithms` and thus `should` be
> `preferred` over `GnuPG 1.x`. You `only need` to use `GnuPG 1.x` if your
> `platform` doesn't `support` GnuPG 2.x, or you need support for some features
> that GnuPG 2.x has deprecated, e.g., decrypting data created with PGP-2 keys.
>
> If you are looking for version 1 of GnuPG, you may find that version installed
> under the name gpg1...

## Main GPG options need-to-knows

`There` are `a lot` of `GPG` options, `in order` to `be able` to `encrypt` and
`decrypt` data, `for starters`, `we` only `need` to `know` the `following` three
`options`:

-   `Create` or `encrypt` (`-c`)
-   `Decrypt` (`-d`)
-   `Extract` and `decrypt` (`no option`)

## Creating a file for encryption

`First`, I `create` a `new file` for `encryption` called `original_file.txt` and
`add` some `text` to `it` at the `same time` using the
`stdout redirect operator`:

```shell
echo This is an encryption test > original_file.txt
```

And `when` I` open` the `new file` with the command `open original_file.txt`, it
`contains` the `following contents`:

```shell
This is an encryption test
```

## Encrypting the original_file.txt file

`Next`, I `run` the `following command` in `Terminal`:

```shell
gpg -c original_file.txt
```

As `mentioned previously`, the `-c` flag `encrypts` a `file`.

The `following` is `returned` as a `result` of the `command`:

```shell
# in my Linux Mint OS, a window prompt appears in which I have to enter a password, and after I enter it twice and it matches, I am taken back to the Terminal prompt.
maria@maria-VirtualBox:~/Desktop$
# next, when I run `ls` against ~/Desktop, the following is returned:
cron-job-scripts linux-shell-scripts original_file.txt.gpg
history.txt   original_file.txt   test-file.txt
```

`According` to the `article` entitled
[File encryption and decryption made easy with GPG](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/encryption-decryption-gpg)
on the `Red Hat blog`,

> The `.gpg` extension isn't required, but it does let the user know which
> decryption tool to use to read the file. You can rename the file to anything
> you want.

## Decrypting the original_file.txt file with the -d flag

Next, `first` I remove `original_file.txt` so that the `encrypted file` is the
`sole source` of the `information` contained in `it`. I do this with the
`rm original_file.txt` command.

Then, to **_decrypt_** `original_file.txt.gpg`, I run
`gpg original_file.txt.gpg` and the `following` is `returned`:

```shell
# first I am provided with a prompt to type in my password and then am returned to the Terminal prompt and the following is stdout there:
gpg: AWS256.CFB encrypted data
gpg: encrypted with 1 passphrase
This is an encryption test # which is the original content of the file
```

## Decrypting and extracting the original_file.txt file without any option

If I want to **_decrypt_** `original_file.txt.gpg` and **_extract_** the
`original_file.txt` file at the `same time`, I simply `run` the
`gpg original_file.txt.gpg` command, `without` any `options`. The `following` is
`returned` as a `result`:

```shell
gpg: zWARNING: no command supplied. Trying tio guess what you mean ...
gpg: AES256.CFB encrypted data
gpg: encrypted with 1 passphrase
```

This `time` the `contents` of the `file` is `not output` to `Terminal`. The
`original_file.txt`, however, `reappears`:

```shell
# I run the `ls` command to see if original_file.txt has been successfully extracted:
ls
# which returns:
cron-job-scripts linux-shell-scripts original_file.txt.gpg
history.txt   original_file.txt   test-file.txt
```

## Decrypting a file using the -d flag vs without any option

When we decrypt a file using the -d flag, we need access to the passphrase
created when the file was encrypted. When we decrypt a file without any options,
we `not need` to `provide` the `passphrase`. This of course would bypass the
need to send the passphrase to the recipient of the encrypted file.

The `downside` of `decrypting` a `file` without any `options`? We `don't` have
to `provide` the `passphrase`, and therefore `this method` is `not` as `secure`.

## Further Reading

`I` also `wrote` an `article` entitled
[Encrypting and Decrypting Files and Strings](/blog/encrypting-and-decrypting-files-and-strings),
in which I `compare` using `Python` to `encrypt` and `decrypt` strings `vs`
using `GnuPG` to `encrypt` and `decrypt` strings and `files` via
the` Command Line` on `macOS`. The `process`(`es`) differ somewhat `from what`
has been `described here`, and `GnuPG` is `not native` to `macOS`.
