    How to create a fullstack application using Django and Python Part 2. I
    create a Django project inside the Django Boards application, break down the
    project structure and what each component means and does, and after creating
    the Django project, I start up the development server.

site and `why` it is `crucial` to `do it`.

## Creating a project in the Django web application

To `create` (`start`) a `new project` in my `Django` application, I `run` the
`following command` at the `root` of the `Django` application (`/django-boards`)
`where` the `venv` folder `resides`:

```shell
django-admin startproject django_boards
```

The `Command Line` utility `django-admin` comes `with` a `Django` install.
`Specifically`, `django-admin` is `Django`'s `command-line utility` for
`administrative tasks`. It `performs` administrative `tasks` related to
`Django`, `such` as `starting` a `Django` project or `creating` a new `Django`
app.

The `django-admin script` should be `on` your `system path` if you `installed`
Django `via` pip3 **[^1**]. If it’s `not` in your `path`, `make sure` you `have`
your `virtual` environment `activated`.

`Django` must be `installed globally` for `django-admin` to be `accessible` from
`anywhere` on your `system`. I `did` install `Django` with `Homebrew` as `well`,
so I `do` have `access` to `django-admin` outside the `Django` application
`itself`.

## The new Django Boards structure including the django_boards project

`With` the `addition` of the `django_boards` project `inside` the
`django-boards` directory, the `django-boards` root `directory` now `contains`
the `following`:

```shell
/django-boards # high level Django application folder for Django project(s) and app(s)
  - /django_boards # root folder of the django_boards project
    - /django_boards # folder of the django_boards project/package
      - __init__.py # file
      - asgi.py # file
      - settings.py # file
      - urls.py # file
      - wsgi.py # file
    - manage.py # file
  - /venv # folder
```

-   `manage.py` is `automatically created` in each` Django` project, and it
    `does` the `same thing` as `django-admin`. However, it `also sets` the
    `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` environment `variable` so that it `points` to your
    project’s `settings.py` file. I will be using manage.py to run the
    development server, tests, create migrations, and more.
-   `__init__.py` initializes the project_boards package. It si an empty file
    and tells Python that the folder it resides in is a package.
-   `asgi.py` **[^2]** is `created` with the `startproject` command. The
    `startproject` command `creates` the `asgi.py` file. It is `not used` by the
    `development server` (`runserver`), but `can` be `used` by any `ASGI server`
    either in `development` or in `production`.
-   `settings.py`contains all the project's configurations.
-   `urls.py` is responsible for mapping the routes and paths in our project. If
    we want to display something in a particular URL, we first have to map it
    here.
-   `wsgi.py` **[^3]** is a simple gateway interface used for deployment.

## Starting up the Django development server

`Django` comes `with` a `simple` development `server`. To `start up` this
`development server`, I `run` the `following command` in `Terminal`:

```shell
python3 manage.py runserver
```

The `first time` that `python3 manage.py runserver` is `run`, the `following` is
`returned` in `Terminal`:

```shell
You have unapplied migrations; your app may not work properly until they are applied.
Run 'python manage.py migrate' to apply them.

August 22, 2024 - 15:50:53
Django version 5.1, using settings 'django_boards.settings'
Starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
Quit the server with CONTROL-C.
```

`Ignore` the `warning` about `unapplied` database `migrations` for `now`. It
`will` be `dealt` with `shortly`.

`Now` I `can` check `out` my `Django` application in the `browser` at
`http://127.0.0.1:8000/`. It `should` look `something` like the `following`:

_Running the Django development server_

`In` the `next section`, I will be `creating` a `Django` app, and will `discuss`
the `two` central `Django` concepts, `project` and `app`, `in` further `detail`.

## Footnotes

**[^1]**: I refer to `pip3` here because I am working with `Python 3.x`. If I
had been `working` with a `version` of `Python` < `3.x` (`2.x`), then I would
simply refer to `pip`.

**[^2]**: `asgi` stands for `Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface`. It was
`introduced` in `Python 3/Django 3`, but had `limited support`. `Full support`
was `introduced` in `Django 4` and `later`.` Python 3` has `native syntax` for
`handling` asynchronous `operations` like `network calls`. `WSGI` and `other`
synchronous `standards` can’t take `advantage` of the `enhanced performance` and
`efficiency` of `async`. That `also` means `WSGI` can’t handle
`advanced protocols` like `WebSocket`.

**[^3]**: `wsgi` stands for `Web Server Gateway Interface`. `WSGI` is
a` mediator` responsible for `conveying communication` between a `web server`
and a `Python web application`. It `explains` how the `web server` communicates
`with` the `app` and `how` the `app` can be `chained` for `processing` a
`request`. It’s `vital` for `deploying` a `Django` or `Flask` app.
