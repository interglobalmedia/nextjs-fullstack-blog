In case if you don’t already know, `OS X` screenshots **_created_** with the
`Shift + Command + 5` **keys** are `pngs` by **_default_**. However, `pngs` are
**_not compatible_** with `GatsbyJS`! And I **_wanted_** to have the `option` of
**creating screenshots** for use on `GatsbyJS` **sites**. I thought, there has
to be a way of **_changing_** the **default** `screenshot` **format**! And guess
what! There is.

If you **want** to **_change_** the `default format` for `screenshots`
**_created_** with the `Shift + Command + 5` **keys** on `Big Sur` (or even
earlier), **_run_** the following `command` in `Terminal` (`iTerm2` for me) and
then **_press_** the `return` **key**:

```shell
defaults write com.apple.screencapture type jpg;killall SystemUIServer
```

It is **_required_** that you **run** this `command` in `Terminal` in order to
**_implement_** the **change**. Yet **_another reason_** why it is **_so
important_** to learn how to use the `Command Line Interface` (`Terminal`
program).

I **_found_** this `information` in the post **_entitled_**
[How to Change the Screenshot File Format to JPG on Mac](https://www.maketecheasier.com/change-screenshot-file-format-mac/)
on the website [maketecheasier.com](https://www.maketecheasier.com/). It **_also
covers_** changing the **_default_** `png` **format** to `GIF`, `TIFF`, `PDF`,
and **_reverting back_** to the **_original_** `screenshot file format` (`png`).
Don’t freak out if you see mention of using the `Command + Shift + 3` **keys**
as the `keyboard shortcut`. When you use the `3` **key**, it **_captures_** your
**_entire screen_**, which you probably don’t want. The `5` **key** allows you
to **_select_** the **part** of your `screen` you **_want_** to **_capture_**,
especially if you **_only want_** to **_capture_** the `exact dimensions` of a
`browser` **tab/window**. You can also make a `screen recording` with the
**_same_** `keyboard shortcut`. **_Instead_** of **_selecting_**
`screen capture`, you would **_select_** `screen recording`. I wrote a post
**_exactly_** about that **_entitled_**
[How to take a screenshot on your Mac (Mojave or later)](https://www.interglobalmedianetwork.com/blog/2020-01-12-how-to-take-a-screenshot-on-your-mac-mojave-or-later/).
It **_covers_** how to make `screen recordings` as well.

Happy screen capture!
