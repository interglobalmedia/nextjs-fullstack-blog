This series is based on a series entitled
[A Complete Beginner's Guide to Django](https://simpleisbetterthancomplex.com/series/beginners-guide/1.11/)
by Vitor Freitas on his site
[simpleisbetterthancomplex.com/](https://simpleisbetterthancomplex.com/) from
over 7 years ago. I have made updates to outdated code/content, added features,
and am making some changes and additions to the structure, functionality, and
design. It is thanks to him that I learned a lot I did not learn anywhere else
about Django! Check it out to compare what he did in his series and development
sequence compared to mine. I hope you will enjoy building this project, I know I
have!

## Series Table of Contents

    In this section, I discuss the Django model basics, I compare the UML Class
    Fields Diagram to the models.py source code, I migrate the models with the
    makemigrations command, apply the model migrations with the migrate command,
    play with the Models API, and discuss the Django Model manager.
1.  [How to create a fullstack application using Django and Python Part 8](/blog/how-to-create-a-fullstack-application-using-django-and-python-part-8):
    In this section, I add an index.html template to a directory called static,
    test the index (home) page, set up the static files, download Bootstrap,
    configure the static directory in settings.py, discuss the collectstatic

    include Bootstrap styling.
1.  [How to create a fullstack application using Django and Python Part 9](http://localhost:3000/blog/jhow-to-create-a-fullstack-application-using-django-and-python-part-9):
    In this section, I introduce the Django Admin, configure the Django Admin by
    creating a superuser, register the boards app in boards/admin.py, add a
    board in the Django Admin interface, and delete a board in the Django Admin
    interface.
1.  [How to create a fullstack application using Django and Python Part 10](/blog/how-to-create-a-fullstack-application-using-django-and-python-part-10):
    In this section, I update the UML Class Diagrams and wireframe(s) to include
    the PostLike Model, and I clarify the concepts of "topic" and "post".
1.  [How to create a fullstack application using Django and Python Part 11](/blog/how-to-create-a-fullstack-application-using-django-and-python-part-11#related-posts):
    In this section, I update the class models in boards/models.py to include
    PostLike, migrate the updated models, add the dynamic path for a single
    board in django_boards/urls.py, create the board_topics view inside
    boards/views.py, create the topics.html template inside the templates
    directory, and create/run tests for BoardTopics.
1.  [How to create a fullstack application using Django and Python Part 12](/blog/how-to-create-a-fullstack-application-using-django-and-python-part-12):
    In this section, I add the IndexTests class to boards/tests.py, update
    templates/index.html to make a failed test pass, write a test for linking
    back to the index/home page from the single Board page, update
    templates/topics.html to link back to the index/home page, and update
    templates/topics.html so a failed test will pass.
1.  [How to create a fullstack application using Django and Python Part 13](/blog/how-to-create-a-fullstack-application-using-django-and-python-part-13):
    In this section, I created a reusable, base template called base.html,
    integrated it into index.html, integrated it into topics.html, tested
    django_boards after making those changes, added a navigation menu to
    base.html, created an app.css file in the static/css directory, changed the
    logo font with a Google font which I imported into app.css, and tweaked the
    logo styling with CSS.
1.  [How to create a fullstack application using Django and Python Part 14](http://localhost:3000/blog/how-to-create-a-fullstack-application-using-django-and-python-part-14#conclusion):
    In this section, I build a NewTopicForm.
1.  [How to create a fullstack application using Django and Python Part 15](/blog/how-to-create-a-fullstack-application-using-django-and-python-table-of-contents):
    In this section, we create an accounts app where everything related to user
    accounts resides.
1.  [How to create a fullstack application using Django and Python Part 16](/blog/how-to-create-a-fullstack-application-using-django-and-python-part-16):
    In this section, I demonstrate an alternative to the original
    test_form_inputs test in which we used the .assertContains() method to
    verify the existence of specific inputs residing in the signup form. I
    install Beautiful Soup 4 and Soup Sieve along with the html5lib HTML parser,
    and then re-create the test_form_inputs test using those packages. The test
    is much shorter, and my approach to discovering the ids of the inputs I want
    to grab by inspecting the signup form element in the browser is quicker and
    much easier to read!
1.  [How to create a fullstack application using Django and Python Part 17](/blog/how-to-create-a-fullstack-application-using-django-and-python-part-17):
    In this section, I improve signup.html template design, add a logout view
    and route, create a dropdown menu for logged in users, create a login.html
    template, url, and redirect, create a reusable template, add non-field
    errors to login.html, create custom template tags to use in form.html, and
    test the template tags.
1.  [How to create a fullstack application using Django and Python Part 18 ](/blog/how-to-create-a-fullstack-application-using-django-and-python-part-18):
    In this section, I create the password_reset routes, views, tests, and
    templates. The results of the password reset process are output to the
    Terminal console. I debug the password_reset_confirm_tests tests to find out
    what the actual csrf token is and hard code it into the test_csrf (function)
    test. I re-use the Beautiful Soup 4 and Soup Sieve packages to refactor the
    test_form_inputs (function) test.
