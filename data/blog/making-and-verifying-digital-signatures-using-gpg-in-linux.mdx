using `GPG` in Linux, and `I` also `discuss` WHY we would `want` to `use` a
`digital signature` in the `first place`.

## So what is a digital signature?

A `digital signature`, which is a `type` of `electronic signature`, is a
`mathematical algorithm` used to `validate` the `authenticity` and `integrity`
of a `message` (i.e., `email`, `credit card` transaction, or
`digital document`).

According to
[CISA](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/understanding-digital-signatures)
**[^1]**,

> `Digital signatures` create a `virtual fingerprint` that is `unique` to a
> `person` or `entity` and are `used` to `identify users` and
> `protect information` in `digital messages` or `documents`. In `emails`, the
> `email content` itself `becomes part` of the `digital signature`.
> `Digital signatures` are `significantly` more `secure` than `other forms` of
> `electronic signatures`.

## Why digital signatures?

`Digital signatures` **_prove_** that a `digital message` or `document` was
`not` modified (`intentionally` or `unintentionally`) `from when` it was
`signed`.

`Digital signatures` **_verify_** the `integrity` of `data` by `generating` a
`unique hash` of the `message` or `document` in `question` and `encrypting` it
`using` the `sender`'s `private key` **[^2]**. The `hash generated` is `unique`
to the `message` or `document`, and `changing` any `part` of it `will`
completely `change` the `hash`.

## The digital signature process

When we have `finished creating` our `message` or `document` that we `want` to
`secure`, we `digitally sign` it and `send` it to the `recipient`. The
`recipient` then `generates` their own `hash` of the `message` or
`digital document` and `decrypts` the `sender`'s hash (`included` in the
`original message`) `using` the `sender`'s `public key` **[^2]**.

The `recipient` **_compares_** the `hash` they `generate` against the `sender`'s
`decrypted hash`. `If` they `match`, the `integrity` of the `message` or
`digital document` has been `verified` and the `sender` is `authenticated`.

According to
[CISA](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/understanding-digital-signatures),

> he security of a digital signature is almost entirely dependent on how well
> the private key is protected. Without PGP or PKI, proving someone's identity
> or revoking a compromised key is impossible; this could allow malicious actors
> to impersonate someone without any method of confirmation.
>
> Through the use of a trusted third party, digital signatures can be used to
> identify and verify individuals and ensure the integrity of the message.
>
> As paperless, online interactions are used more widely, digital signatures can
> help you secure and safeguard the integrity of your data. By understanding and
> using digital signatures, you can better protect your information, documents,
> and transactions.

## Why digital signatures should be used with PGP (or PKI)

Using `digital signatures` with
[PGP](https://www.encryptionconsulting.com/how-to-generate-pgp-key-pair/) or
[PKI (public key infrastructure)](<https://www.keyfactor.com/education-center/what-is-pki/#:~:text=Public%20key%20infrastructure%20(PKI)%20governs,end%2Dto%2Dend%20communications.>)
`key pairs` strengthens the `digital signatures` and `reduces` possible
`security issues` **_related_** to **_transmitting_** `public keys` by
`validating` that the `key` **_belongs_** to the `sender` and `verifying` the
`identity` of the `sender`. The `security` of a `digital signature`
**_depends_** on `how strong` the `protection` of the `private key` is.
**_Without_** `PGP` (or `PKI`), `verifying` someone's `identity` or `revoking` a
`compromised key` is `impossible`. This **_means_** `malicious actors` could
`impersonate someone` without any `means` of `confirmation`.

`Understanding` and `using` digital `signatures` permits us to `better protect`
our `information`, `documents`, and `transactions` in the `digital age`.

## Creating a digital signature using PGP

`Since` I `already` have written `articles` touching upon `PGP`,
[Encrypting and decrypting a file with GPG in Linux](http://localhost:3000/blog/encrypting-and-decrypting-a-file-with-gpg-in-linux)
and
[Encrypting and Decrypting Files and Strings](http://localhost:3000/blog/encrypting-and-decrypting-files-and-strings),
`in` this `article` I will `show how` to `create` a `digital signature` using
`PGP`.

### Creating the PGP key pair

A `PGP key pair` is an `example` of `asymmetric encryption`.
`Asymmetric encryption` is the `process` of `using` a `public key` from a
`public/private` key `pair` to `encrypt` plaintext, and then` using` the
corresponding `private key` to `decrypt` the ciphertext. `In` other `words`,
`asymmetric encryption` uses `two` different `keys` to `encrypt` and `decrypt`
each `file`, then `two` more `keys` to `sign` and `verify` each `file`. Both
parties – `sender` and `recipient` – `need` to `exchange` their `public keys`
before `any transfer` can `take place`.

The `sender encrypts` the `file` using the `recipient`’s `public key`. The
`recipient decrypts` the `file` using their `private key`.

`Asymmetric encryption` is `considered` more `secure` due to the `use` of `two`
separate `keys`, `making` it `harder` for `attackers` to `compromise` the
`system`. And we are `dealing` with `asymmetric encryption` here.

`PGP` itself provides `end-to-end encryption`, `integrity checking` and
`authentication`. It is `commonly used` for `encrypting` and `decrypting` texts,
files, directories and whole disk partitions.

I `also wrote` an `article` a `while back` regarding `symmetric encryption`
entitled
[Encrypting and Decrypting Files and Strings](http://localhost:3000/blog/encrypting-and-decrypting-files-and-strings)
where I discuss `symmetric encryption`. `Symmetric encryption` is `not` as
`secure` by the `nature` of `how` it `works`, and also `more limiting`.
`Symmetric encryption` is also known as a `private-key encryption`. It is called
`symmetric` because, it `makes use` of the `same key` for both `encryption` of
`plain text` (`sending message`) and `decryption` of `cipher text`
(`received message`).

`In order` to `be able` to `sign` a `message` or `document`, for example, one
`first` has to `create` a `PGP private` and `public` key pair`:

```shell
gpg --full-generate-key
```

The `--full-generate-key` flag as `opposed` to `gpg --gen-key`, `provides` a
`full featured` key generation `dislog`. It `returns` something like the
`following`:

```shell

GnuPG needs to construct a user ID to identify your key.

Real name: Maria

We need to generate a lot of random bytes. It is a good idea to perform some other action (type on keyboard, move the mouse, utilize the disks) during the prime generation; this gives the random number generator a better change to gain enough entropy.

gpg; revocation certificate stored as '/home/maria/.gnupg/openpgp-revocs.d/
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.rev'
public and secret key created and signed.
```

## Editing the PGP public key

I had `created` a `revocation certificate` previously. Ideally, you `create` it
`right after` creating your` PGP key pair`. `However`, I `noticed` that I
`entered` the `wrong` local `email address`. So I `did` the `following` to
`change` my `local email address` to the `correct one`:

`First` I ran `gpg --edit Maria` (the `name` of my `key pair` is the `real name`
I `provided` at the `beginning`), and the `following appeared`:

```shell
gpg (GnuPG) 2.4.4; Copyright (C) 2024 g10 Code GmbH
This is free software; you are free to change and redistribute it.
There is NO WARRANTY, to the extent of the law.

Secret key is available.

sec   rsa3072/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
      created: 2024-08-09   expires: never    usage: SC
      trust: ultimate   validity: ultimate
ssb   rsa3072/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
      created: 2024-08-09   expires: never    usage: E
[ultimate] (1). Maria (GPG key pair for local testing purposes) <maria@maria-Virtual-Box>

gpg> uuid
```

It is `not` noted `anywhere`, `but` I `had` to `type` `"uuid"` in the `gpg>`
prompt. Then the `following appeared` after I `hit` the `Return` key:

```shell
Real name: Maria
Email address: maria@maria-VirtualBox # here is where I provide my correct local email
Comment: GPG key pair for local testing with correct email # I indicate that I have provided the correct email now
You selected this USER-ID:
  "maria (GPG key pair for local testing with correct email) <maria@maria-VirtualBox>"

gpg> # here i hit Control + D key to exit
Save changes? (y/N) y
```

`During` this `process` I am `also prompted` for `my passphrase` I `had created`
when I `originally created` the `PGP key pair`.

## Listing the PGP public keys

Next, I can `check` to `make sure` that `everything` was `successfully updated`
by running `gpg --list-keys`, and `something like` the `following` is
`returned`:

```shell
/home/maria/.gnupg/pubring.kbx
------------------------------

pub   rsa3072 2024-08-09 [SC]
      xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
uid           [ultimate] Maria (GPG key pair for local testing with correct email) <maria@maria-VirtualBox>
uid           [ultimate] Maria (GPG key pair for local testing purposes) <maria@maria-Virtual-Box>
sub   rsa3072 2024-08-09 [E]
```

## Deleting a PGP public key uid

`As` you `can see`, I have `two uids`. I `want` to `get rid` of `the one` that
is `not` correct (the `second one`). So I `run` the `following`:

```shell
gpg --edit-key Maria
```

`And` it `returns` the `following`:

```shell
gpg --edit-key Maria
gpg (GnuPG) 2.4.4; Copyright (C) 2024 g10 Code GmbH
This is free software: you are free to change and redistribute it.
There is NO WARRANTY, to the extent permitted by law.

Secret key is available.

     trust: ultimate      validity: ultimate

     created: 2024-08-09  expires: never       usage: E
[ultimate] (1). Maria (GPG key pair for local testing with correct email) <maria@maria-VirtualBox>
[ultimate] (2)  Maria (GPG key pair for local testing purposes) <maria@maria-Virtual-Box>

gpg> uid 2

sec  rsa3072/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

     trust: ultimate      validity: ultimate
ssb  rsa3072/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
     created: 2024-08-09  expires: never       usage: E
[ultimate] (1). Maria (GPG key pair for local testing with correct email) <maria@maria-VirtualBox>
[ultimate] (2)* Maria (GPG key pair for local testing purposes) <maria@maria-Virtual-Box>

gpg> deluid
Really remove this user ID? (y/N) y

sec  rsa3072/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
     created: 2024-08-09  expires: never       usage: SC
     trust: ultimate      validity: ultimate
ssb  rsa3072/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
     created: 2024-08-09  expires: never       usage: E
[ultimate] (1). Maria (GPG key pair for local testing with correct email) <maria@maria-VirtualBox>

gpg>
Save changes? (y/N) y
```

`When` I `get` the first `gpg>` prompt, I type `uid 2` because `that` is the
`uuid` I `want` to `delete` and `that` has the `incorrect` local
`email address`. Then, `with` the second `gpg>` prompt I `get`, I type `deluid`,
because I want to delete `uid 2`. Then it `prompts me` if I
`Really remove this user ID? (y/N)` and I type `y`. And `finally`, with the last
`gpg>` prompt, I `indicate` I `want` to `save` my `changes` by typing `y`.

Now I can `check` to `make sure` the `edit` was `successful` by running
`gpg --list-keys` again. And if `uid 1` is `no longer` listed `there`, I `know`
that my `edit` was `successful`!

## Creating a revocation certificate for PGP key pair

Next, I `want` to `make sure` that I `create` a `revocation certificate` for my
`PHP key pair` in `case` if I `lose` my `keys` or if they have been
`compromised`. One `should` do `this` before `actually starting` to `use` the
`PGP keys`.

In `order` to `create` a `revocation certificate` associate with my `Maria` PGP
key pair, I `do` the `following`:

```shell
# command to create a revocation certificate
gpg --output revocation.crt --gen-revoke maria@maria-VirtualBox

sec  rsa3072/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx 2024-08-09 Maria (GPG key pair for local testing with correct email) <maria@maria-VirtualBox>

Create a revocation certificate for this key? (y/N) y
Please select the reason for the revocation:
  0 = No reason specified
  1 = Key has been compromised
  2 = Key is superseded
  3 = Key is no longer used
  Q = Cancel
(Probably you want to select 1 here)
Your decision? 0
Enter an optional description; end it with an empty line:
> revocation certificate for local purposes
>
Reason for revocation: No reason specified
revocation certificate for local purposes
Is this okay? (y/N) y
ASCII armored output forced.
Revocation certificate created.

Please move it to a medium which you can hide away; if Mallory gets
access to this certificate he can use it to make your key unusable.
It is smart to print this certificate and store it away, just in case
your media become unreadable.  But have some caution:  The print system of
your machine might store the data and make it available to others!
```

## Making a signature

There are several ways of signing a file: sign, check, encrypt, decrypt.

-   The `--sign` or -s flag is used to sign a message/make a signature.
-   The `--clear-sign`flag is used to make a clear text signature.
-   The `--detach-sign` or `-b` flag is used to make a detached signature.
-   The `--verify` flag is used to verify a signature.

`In` this `article`, I `focus` on a (complete) `signature` created `with` the
`--sign` or `-s` option.

`When` we `use` the `--sign` or `s` flag on a `file`, the `file` is effectively
`encrypted` with the `private key`. The `signature` is `created` using the
`private key` of the `signer`, and the `signature` is `verified` using the
corresponding `public key`. `As` mentioned `earlier`, the `public key` is
`required` to `view` the `contents` of the `file`. This `forces` the `recipient`
to `verify` the `origin` and `removes` any `clear text` content **[^4]** from
transit. It is `not` private since `anyone` with the `public key` can `decrypt`
the `file`.

To `make` a `signature` on a `file` called `make_signature.txt` that `contains`
the `following text`:

```shell
# command I used to both create the file and the file content:
echo This is a file I am using for demonstration purposes regarding digital signing. > make_signature.txt`
# command I used to sign the file
gpg -s make_signature.txt
# which returned the following:
# first I get a passphrase prompt and have to enter my password associated with the PGP key pair
# then I am returned to the Terminal command prompt
# the signature command results in a file called make_signature.txt.gpg
```

### Verifying the signature

To `verify only` the `signature`, I `run` the `following command`:

```shell
gpg --verify make_signature.txt.gpg
```

Which `returns` the `following` in `Terminal`:

```shell
gpg: Signature made Sat 10 Aug 2024 12:21:35 PM EDT
gpg:                using RSA key .......
gpg: Good signature from "Maria (GPG key pair for local testing with correct email) <maria@maria-VirtualBox>" [ultimate]
```

To `view` the `contents` AND `show` the `signature verification`, I `use` the
`--decrypt` option:

```shell
gpg --decrypt make_signature.txt.gpg
# which returns the following:
This is a file I am using for demonstration purposes regarding digital signing.
gpg: signature made Sat 10 Aug 2024 12:3524 PM EDT
gpg:                using RSA key ...
gpg: Good signature from "Maria (GPG key pair for local testing with correct email) <maria@maria-VirtualBox>" [ultimate]
```

## Conclusion

`In` this `article`, we `went over`:

-   what a digital signature is, why use them,
-   the digital signature process,
-   why they should be used with PGP (or PKI, but that is outside the scope of
    this article),
-   how to create a digital signature using a PGP key pair (a form of asymmetric
    encryption),
-   why asymmetric encryption is more secure than symmetric encryption,
-   how to edit a public PGP key, how to list the public PGP keys,
-   how to delete a PGP public key uid,
-   how to create a revocation certificate for a PGP key pair and why you should
    have one,
-   how to make a signature, and how to verify it.

In my `next post` regarding `digital signatures`, I will `discuss` how to `make`
a `detached signature` using a `PGP key pair` and `how` it differs from a
complete `digital signature` using a `PGP key pair`. Stay tuned!

## Footnotes

**[^1]**: `CISA` stands for `Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency`.

**[^2]**: When we create a `PGP` key, a `key pair` containing a `public key` and
`private key` is `generated`. `We` can `share` the `public key` with `anyone`
who `wishes` to `send` us `encrypted messages` or `files`, but the `private key`
must be `known only` to `us` and is `used` to `decrypt` received `messages`.

**[^3]**: According to
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_infrastructure),

> `PKI`, or `Public Key Infrastructure`, is a set of roles, policies, hardware,
> software and procedures needed to create, manage, distribute, use, store and
> revoke digital certificates and manage public-key encryption.
>
> The `purpose` of a `PKI` is to facilitate the secure electronic transfer of
> information for a range of network activities such as e-commerce, internet
> banking and confidential email. It is required for activities where simple
> passwords are an inadequate authentication method and more rigorous proof is
> required to confirm the identity of the parties involved in the communication
> and to validate the information being transferred.

**[^4]**: `Clear text` content means information or data that is transmitted or
stored without any encryption or obfuscation.
