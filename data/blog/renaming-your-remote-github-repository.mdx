***Today*** I was ***going through*** and ***re-organizing*** my `JavaScript30` ***projects*** and ***adding*** `Github Wiki pages` to them. I ***came across*** ***one*** `repository` which I ***wanted*** to ***rename***, because it ***did not*** `mirror` the `name` in the `JavaScript30` ***repository***! ***In addition***, I ***wanted*** to ***rename*** the `local repository` to ***mirror*** the ***name*** of my
***remote*** `repository`.

***First*** I ***renamed*** the `local repository`. I was ***already*** in the ***repository*** which I ***wanted*** to ***rename***, `array-cardio`s. I ***wanted*** to ***rename*** it to `array-cardio-day-1`. In `CLI` (`Command Line Interface`) I ***typed***

```shell
mv ~/development/array-cardio ~/development/array-cardio-day-1
```

That ***renamed*** `array-cardio` to `array-cardio-day-1`. ***However***, the `mv` ***command*** can ***also*** be ***used*** to ***move*** `files` and `directories`. If I ***wanted*** to ***move*** my `cardio1.js` ***file*** into my `~/development` ***folder*** where I ***have*** all my ***projects***, ***for example***, I ***would type***

```shell
mv cardio1.js ~/development/
```

and `cardio1.js` which was ***residing in***

```shell
~/development/array-cardio-day-1
```

would ***now*** be ***residing in*** the

```
~/development/
```

`development` ***folder*** (aka **_directory_**) itself. If I ***wanted*** to ***move*** it ***back*** to the `array-cardio-day-1` ***directory*** and ***within*** the `scripts` ***directory*** in `array-cardio-day-1`, I ***would type***

```shell
mv cardio1.js array-cardio-day-1/scripts/
```

***from within*** the `~/development` ***folder***. So ***in other words***, I would ***make sure*** that I was ***first within*** the `~/development` ***folder***, and ***then*** I ***would type*** the `command`. I ***don’t*** have to ***append*** `~/development` to the ***beginning*** of the `destination path`, ***because*** I am ***already there***.

***Then*** I ***checked*** to ***make sure*** I ***had done*** it ***right*** and `cd`(ed) ***into*** the `project` by ***typing***:

```shell
array-cardio-day-1
```

while ***still in*** the `~/development` ***folder***. It ***took*** me ***right*** to it. This is just ***one*** of the ***features*** that ***attracted*** me to `Oh my zsh`. I ***didn’t have*** to ***type*** `cd array-cardio-day-1`, ***just*** `array-cardio-day-1`.

***Another great*** little thing that ***I have*** with my `Oh my zsh` ***install***, is that I can ***type*** `development` ***lowercase*** or `Development` ***uppercase***. The ***folder*** was actually ***created*** with an ***uppercase*** `D`, `Development`. ***But*** I ***can type*** either `development` or `Development` to `cd` ***into*** the ***folder***, or ***use either*** in ***commands***. As
shown above, I ***used*** the ***lowercase*** `d` for ***speed***, ***ease*** of ***convenience***. What’s ***even more*** `interesting` is that ***when*** I ***type***

```shell
development
```

and ***hit*** `return`, this is ***how*** the `path` I ***receive*** looks in `iTerm2`

```shell
~/development:
```

***When*** I ***type***

```shell
Development
```

and ***hit*** `return`, this is ***how*** the `path` I ***receive*** looks in `iTerm2`

```shell
~/Development:
```

***As*** I ***mentioned earlier***, I ***wanted*** to ***rename*** my ***remote*** `git repository`. ***After renaming*** my ***local*** `git repository`, I ***went*** to `Github` to ***rename*** my ***remote*** `repository`.

I ***first*** went ***into*** the `Settings` ***tab*** of the `array-cardio` (it’s original name) ***repository***, and ***at*** the ***top*** was the ***option*** `Repository Name`. ***Underneath that***, I just ***typed*** in the ***name*** I ***wanted*** to ***change*** the `repository` to, and then ***hit*** the
`rename` ***button***. ***Now*** `array-cardio-day-1` ***appeared*** as the ***name*** of the ***repo***. ***Next***, I ***exited settings*** and ***clicked*** on the `repository name` to ***access*** the `clone` or
`download` ***button***. I **_copied_** the `new path` to the `repository` ***using***
`SSH`, and ***did*** the ***following*** in `CLI`:

```shell
git remote rm origin
```

This removed the old `remote origin` path (aka the old remote repo path). Then I
typed

```shell
git remote add origin git@github.com:interglobalmedia/array-cardio-day-1.git
```

This ***added*** the **_new_** `remote origin` ***path*** to the `local repo`. ***Remember how*** you ***always*** type in this ***second line*** when ***pushing*** your ***local*** `repository` to your ***remote*** `repository` on `Github` for the ***first time***? Well, it’s the ***same thing*** here ***after*** you have ***renamed*** your ***remote repo***. You are ***adding*** a ***new*** `name/path` to your ***local*** `repository`. If you ***want*** to be ***really anal*** about it, the ***next time*** you ***push*** to the ***remote repo***, you can ***type***

```shell
git push -u origin master
```

to ***make sure*** that ***local*** and ***remote repos*** are ***keeping track*** of ***each other***. `-u` is ***shorthand*** for `-upstream`. `git push -u origin master` is what you would ***type*** when **_pushing_** a `local repo` to **Github** for the ***first time***.

***How*** do ***things work*** for you ***using*** `Oh my zsh`? I ***would love*** to ***know***!

*Have fun* `commanding` with *Oh my Zsh*!
