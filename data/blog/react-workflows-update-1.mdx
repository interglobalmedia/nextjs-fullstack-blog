***Slide from my React workflows presentation slide deck***

My `React Workflow` **_journey_** did ***not stop*** with my `presentation` on the
***topic*** the ***other day***. I am ***working*** on a ***new rendition*** of my `portfolio site` ***using*** `React`, and ***while working*** on it, I **_checked_** another application I have **_hosted_** on `gh-pages`, and ***noticed*** that it **_did not_** have `production quality code`. I ***made*** the ***necessary changes*** to
my `webpack config`, **_splitting_** my ***original*** `config` there
**_into two_**: `webpack-dev.config.js` and `webpack-prod.config.js`. And ***then*** I
**_updated them_** to the ***latest changes*** necessary to ***make*** the
`configs` **_valid_**. When I ***finally completed*** all ***changes***, I `re-deployed`
the `app` ***in question*** to `gh-pages`. ***Now*** the `ReactDevTool` ***showed*** a
`black icon` ***indicating*** `production quality deployment`. What ***made***
the `production quality`**_ possible_** was the ***addition*** of the
`webpack uglifyjs plugin`. ***However***, ***in the past***, ***with*** a ***couple*** of ***other apps*** I had ***created***, I had ***tremendous issues*** with the ***plugin***. In ***one case***, it ***might have***
had to ***do with*** the `code` in ***all honesty***. I’m ***not sure***. In ***other cases***, there simply were ***conflicts*** with ***other plugins*** and ***configs*** in `package.json`. So `minification` ***never*** even ***took place***. ***At the time***, I was ***using*** `version 0.3` ***something*** of the ***plugin***. ***Today***, I ***installed*** `version 0.4.6`. And ***guess what***? If
you are ***familiar*** with ***my presentation***, ***remember*** the ***burning question*** I ***asked*** regarding ***keeping*** the **_filenames_** of `[chunkhash] bundle.js` and `runtime.js` the **_same_** if there were ***no changes*** to the ***files***? When I would **run** a **_new build_** in which there were no changes to either of
those files, their `[chunkhash]` would **_change_**. Today, when I **ran**
**_new builds_** in which there were **no changes**, none of my js files’
`chunkhashes` **changed**! I still had the **issue** of `no source-maps` being
**_emitted_** in `production` for **_any of_** my **js files** because of the
`webpack uglifyjs plugin`, but was very glad to know that I had achieved my
goal.

**_However_**, I’m not quite sure how I got there! I **_do_** **have**
**_additional plugins_** **installed**. The `webpack uglifyjs plugin` is a
**_different_** `version`. ***Go figure***!

If ***anyone*** has had a ***similar experience*** and has ***figured*** out ***why*** I was ***successful*** in ***making sure*** that the `chunkhashes` for ***all*** my `js files` would ***not change*** if there were ***no changes***, ***please*** let me ***know***! The `webpack` ***documentation*** is ***not*** very ***clear*** on ***this issue***. It ***focuses mainly*** on the `vendor.js` ***file***. ***Thanks***!
