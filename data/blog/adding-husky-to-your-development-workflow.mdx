I **_wanted_** to **_add_** a `CSS linter` to my **_students'_**
`portfolio site repository` on **_Github_** so that I could **_point out_**
`errors` in the `HTML` or `CSS code` when **_created_**. And I **_wanted_** to
**_show_** how one could **_prevent_** the `deployment` of the `code` to a
**_remote server_** if such errors were present. And what better way in case of
HTML and CSS than with the addition of stylelint to the project workflow.

But of course **_that_** would **_also mean_** the **_addition_** of `husky` to
the `workflow`. I **_use_** the `husky` **_npm package_** to **_make sure_**
that my `code` does **_not contain_** any `errors` before I **_commit_** my
**_changes_** to my **_remote repository_**. I **_want_** it to be **_production
ready_**!

First I **_installed_** the `husky package` **_using_** `npm`. So:

```shell
npm i husky -D
```

Next, I **_wanted_** to **_enable_** `Git hooks`, since **_that_** is **_what_**
`husky` is **_all about_**. So I **_ran_** the **_following_** `command` in
`Terminal`:

```shell
npx husky install
```

And then to **_automatically_** have `Git hooks` **_enabled_** `after install`,
I **_edited_** my `package.json` by **_running_** the **_following command_** in
`Terminal`:

```shell
npm pkg set scripts.prepare="husky install"
```

And this **_resulted_** in the **_creation_** of **_following_** `local script`
**_inside_** my `package.json`:

```json
// package.json
{
	"scripts": {
		"prepare": "husky install"
	}
}
```

**_Next_**, I **_wanted_** to **_create_** a `hook` that would **_check_**
whether my `CSS` had any `errors` or **_not_**. I had **_already created_** a
`local script` **_called_** `validate` which **_looks like_** the
**_following_**:

```json
"validate": "npm run stylelint",
```

And my `stylelint` **_local script_** which `validate` **_executes_** when I
**_run_** the `validate script` looked like the **_following_**:

```json
"stylelint": "stylelint **/*.css",
```

What the `value` of the `“stylelint”` script **_means_** is that **_within_**
any `folder` in the **_root_** of my `project` that **_contains_** a `file` with
the `.css` **_extension_**, **_lint_** it and **_print out_** any `errors` that
**_may come in_** the `VS Code Integrated Terminal` **_console_**. `**` stands
for folder, and `/*.css` **_stands for_** any files which **_contain_** the
`.css` **_extension_**.

**_Next_**, I **_actually_** had to **_create_** a `hook` which would
**_execute_** my `validate script` **_whenever_** I would **_make_** a (`local`)
`commit` from **_within_** my `project`. So **_when_** the `stylelinting` would
**_fail_**, I would **_not_** be able to **_execute_** the `commit`.

In **_order_** to **_create_** a `“pre-commit”` **_git hook_** which would
**_execute_** my `validate` **_local script_**, I **_first ran_** the
**_following_** in my `VS Code Integrate Terminal`:

```shell
npx husky add .husky/pre-commit “npm run validate”
```

And the **_following_** was **_returned_** to the `Terminal console`:

```shell
husky - created .husky/pre-commit
```

This **_created_** a `Git hook` **_called_** `pre-commit` **_inside_** my
`.husky` **_folder_** which was **_created_** when I **_installed_** `husky`.
And **_inside_** the `pre-commit` **_file_**, the **_following_** was
**_added_**:

```shell
#!/usr/bin/env sh
. "$(dirname -- "$0")/_/husky.sh"

npm run validate
```

Then I **_tested_** this out to **_make sure_** that my `husky` pre-commit
`Git hook` **_actually worked_** when I **_tried_** to `commit` a **_change_**
inside my `project`. So I **_purposely created_** an `error` in the
`styles/main.css` **_file_**. And then I **_tried_** to `commit` the
**_change_**. As a **_result_**, when I **_tried_** to **_commit_**
`styles/main.css`, the **_following_** was **_returned_** in `Terminal`:

```shell
git commit

> professional-portfolio-site-class-demo-fall-2022@1.0.0 validate
> npm run stylelint


> professional-portfolio-site-class-demo-fall-2022@1.0.0 stylelint
> stylelint **/*.css


styles/main.css
 11:1  ✖  Unclosed block  CssSyntaxError

1 problem (1 error, 0 warnings)

husky - pre-commit hook exited with code 2 (error)
```

I had **_purposely removed_** the `body element selector rule set`’s
**_closing_** `curly brace`. As **_indicated_** by
`11:1 ✖ Unclosed block CssSyntaxError`, **_where_** the
`body element selector rule set` **_begins_**. So then I **_added back_** the
**_closing_** `curly brace` and **_tried_** to `commit` **_again_**.

**_First_** I **_added_** my **_new change_**, which was the **_fix_** to the
`body element selector rule set` **_running_** `git add styles/main.css`, and
then I **_ran_** `git commit` **_again_**.

```shell
git commit

> professional-portfolio-site-class-demo-fall-2022@1.0.0 validate
> npm run stylelint


> professional-portfolio-site-class-demo-fall-2022@1.0.0 stylelint
> stylelint **/*.css

On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.
```

**_This time_**, the `commit` was a **_success_**!

So **_each time_** there is an `error` in my `CSS code`, I **_can’t commit_**
that **_change_**. I **_first_** have to **_fix_** the `error`, `stage` that
**_change_**, and THEN **_execute_** the `git commit` command **_again_**.

And **_all this_** was **_done_** by **_manually installing_** `husky` and
**_manually_** setting up my `Git hook`.
