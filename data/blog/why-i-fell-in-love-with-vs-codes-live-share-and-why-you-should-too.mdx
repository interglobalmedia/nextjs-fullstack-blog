***VS Code’s Live Share***

Last night I introduced `Live Share` to my class I am teaching online. Because
we are not physically in the same room, but perhaps we want to **_collaborate_** on `code` within the same editor (which is not even possible if we are in the same physical location anyway), we can **_connect_** with each other **_via_** `VS Code`’s `Live Share` **extension**.

My students were able to go into my `slide deck` for the class and **_edit it_** in `real time`. Then they **_saved_** the **_changes_**, and I then subsequently made **_necessary updates_** to **_reflect_** those **changes**. It **_increased_** their `attention` and also their `engagement`. We all had a
certain learning curve we had to overcome, but this after all was the **_first
time_** we had used it for the class. I believe it is a **_fantastic tool_** to **use**, and students (or team members at work) can **_check out_** `code`, make **_changes_** to **test** in `real time`, and also have the **_ability_** to **view** the **_impact_** of those **changes** **_immediately_** via the `Live Share` `“Shared Server”` feature. **_Either_** one can **use** `VS Code`’s `Live Server` **extension** and **share** the `URL` that **_appears_** in the `browser` when the `project` **_opens up_** as a **result** of **_clicking_** on the `“Go Live”` tab at the **bottom** of the **_active_** `VS Code` **window instance**, **_or_** one can even **use** the `port` used by `npm packages` like `nodemon` **in order** to **_view_** the `project` in `question` in a `local server` **_instance_**. **_Physical location_** is **_no longer_** `important` or `relevant` when **_collaborating_** on **_projects_**. It can **_all_** be **done** from **_all over the place_** with `tools` such as Live
Share`. This is great in our era of `remote/hybrid learning`or`work`. I ***am in*** `100%`.

There is also a `chat area` that is **_initialized_** within the `VS Code`
`collaborative session instance` where students or team members can **_share_** their **_thoughts_** or **_ideas_** in `real time`.

And if on **_throws in_** something like `Zoom` or `Google Meet` (in **_our
case_**, it is `Blackboard Collaborate Ultra` for **_student learning_**
**online**), one can **_add_** `audio/visual` **features**. **_This way_**,
`collaborators` can actually **_speak_** with **each other** and also
**_share_** their **screens** if **_necessary_**. `Live Share` does **_not_**
include `audio`, and the `Live Share` **extension pack** does **_not_** work,
because the `audio feature` **_breaks_** it. The `audio feature` is
**_blocked_** by `browsers` for `security reasons`. When it **_first_** came out `3` years ago, `Live Share`’s `audio feature` **_did work_**, but the `quality` was **_not great_**. With the advent of `Zoom`, `Google Meet`, and **_other_** like tools, it really doesn’t matter anyway.

I **_highly encourage_** trying out `VS Code`’s `Live Share`. It works like a
charm! Also **_read_** my `article` **_entitled_**
[Successfully Using Live Share Extension in VS Code](/blog/successfully-using-live-share-extension-in-vs-code/),
which **_takes_** you **_through_** the **_steps_** of `getting set up` with
`VS Code Live Share`. **_After_** this `setup process`, you will be **_ready_** for `live code collaboration` with your `team members` or `fellow students` in **_real time_**. `Physical location` is **_no longer_** an **issue**! **_However_**, you can **_still use_** this `handy tool` if you ARE in the **_same_** `physical location`, because **_without_** it, you **_still_** would **_not be able_** to **_collaborate_** within a **_common_**
`text editor instance`!
