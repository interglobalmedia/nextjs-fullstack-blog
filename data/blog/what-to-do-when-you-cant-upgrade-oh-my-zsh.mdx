I have been ***using*** the `Z Shell`, specifically `Oh My Zsh`, for almost ***two years*** now. It worked ***without*** a ***hitch*** for a ***while***, and then ***one day*** it ***didn’t work*** so ***smoothly***. It ***had something*** to ***do*** with my `PATH configuration`. I’m ***not sure*** whether the `issue` ***began*** `before` or `after` I ***installed*** `El Capitan` (but I don’t
think so), ***or*** if it ***was*** a `ruby gems` ***installation issue***. I ***think*** it ***was*** the ***latter***. Anyway, it ***never seemed*** to ***resolve*** itself.

I started to **_dive deeper_** into `Command Line`. I was ***getting*** to ***know*** my `computer` ***much better***. ***One*** of my `New Year’s Resolutions` is to ***become*** extremely **_well acquainted with_** the `Command Line`, and ***therefore*** `my computer`. I ***know*** that ***this*** will ***make me*** a ***MUCH better*** `developer`, `designer`, and `technologist` ***in general***. It will ***also help*** me with ***another*** of ***my*** `New Year’s resolutions`.
***Increasing*** `my knowledge` of ***personal*** `cyber security`. ***Everyone*** these days ***should educate*** `themselves` ***about*** `personal cyber security`. It’s a ***crazy world*** out there in the ***realm*** of` technology`!

But my `Z shell` education ***sky rocketed*** when I ***came across*** `Wes Bos`’ ***video series*** entitled `“Command Line For Power Users”`. In it he ***goes*** into depth about ***how*** to ***set up*** the `Z Shell` on your `computer`, and ***specifically*** `Oh my zsh`. ***There*** is ***not much*** great `documentation` ***on*** the ***topic*** all in one place ***geared*** at `developers`. ***Many*** even **_frown upon_** **replacing** the `default bash`. I **_disagree_**. I ***think*** it’s ***great***. I will be very soon ***learning more*** about ***exactly why***.

***But*** I ***digress***. I **_re-encountered_** my `$PATH` ***problem*** with `oh-my-zsh` when ***playing around*** with the ***different*** `oh-my-zsh` **themes** I ***have installed*** on my `computer`. ***Everything*** was `fine` ***until*** I ***added*** the `Soliah theme`. It ***told me*** that my `rvm` (`Ruby Version Manager`) `$PATH` was **_configured incorrectly_** and
that I ***should*** `fix it`.This is the ***message*** I ***would get*** in `Terminal` (now `iTerm2`):

```shell
Warning! PATH is not properly set up, '/Users/mariacam/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.2.2/bin' is not available,
usually this is caused by shell initialization files - check them for 'PATH=...' entries,
it might also help to re-add RVM to your dotfiles: 'rvm get stable --auto-dotfiles',
to fix temporarily in this shell session run: 'rvm use ruby-2.2.2'.
```

So I ***googled*** for a ***fix*** to the `issue`. After ***much searching***, I ***finally*** came across a `fix` which was ***clearly explained***:

```shell
This is what corrected the error for me:
My .bashrc:

The last line should be:

export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.rvm/bin" # Add RVM to PATH for scripting

My .bash_profile

The last 2 lines should be:

[[ -s "$HOME/.profile" ]] && source "$HOME/.profile" # Load the default .profile

[[ -s "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm" ]] && source "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm" # Load RVM into a shell session *as a function*
```

I ***found*** the ***same*** `fix` ***elsewhere***, ***but*** the ***explanations*** were ***not*** as ***clear***. My `.bashrc` **_already contained_** the **line mentioned above**, but my
`.bash_profile` contained `PATH` **_instead of_** `HOME`. I ***think*** `something happened` ***during*** `installation` of my `ruby gems`. I ***installed*** that ***when*** I was ***taking*** a `Web Development Course`, and ***already*** had ***installed*** `Z shell/Oh my zsh`. I ***clearly remember*** the `teacher` ***telling me*** that I ***should*** be ***using*** the ***default***
`bash shell`, and I ***said*** `“No. I want to use Oh my zsh.”` Then he ***created*** a `hack` so that I ***would*** `be able` to ***use both*** (`nightmare`), and a ***whole bunch*** of ***other stuff*** which he ***didn’t even*** `clue me` ***in on***. ***That’s why*** I ***will say*** it ***again*** (and ***again***
and ***again*** and ***again*** if I ***have to***): ***so important*** to ***know*** `Command Line`, and thus ***get*** to ***know*** the ***inner workings*** of your `computer`, so that you ***don’t have*** to ***be*** at the ***mercy*** of ***others*** who then ***won’t*** even ***enlighten*** you ***as*** to ***what*** they ***have done*** to your `machine`! And `their fix` ***won’t necessarily*** be the ***right one*** for ***you*** OR ***your machine***! ***It’s like*** a `doctor` ***not knowing*** `his` or `her` ***anatomy***!

The `issue` ***wasn’t resolved*** `immediately`, ***however***. ***Why***? ***First*** of ***all***, I ***didn’t*** completely ***quit*** `iTerm2`. I ***only closed*** the `window`. ***In order*** for `iTerm2` (or `Terminal`) to ***register*** the ***change***, you ***have*** to ***quit*** the `program` and ***re-open*** it. ***OR***, you ***should type*** the **command** `source + path to file` that was ***changed***. ***For instance***, if I ***changed*** the `oh-my-zsh` **theme** I was ***using*** in `iTerm2` in my `.zshrc` file, I ***would save*** the `file`, ***go back*** into `iTerm2` and ***type*** the `command`

```shell
source ~/.zshrc
```

and ***hit*** `return`. I ***would*** immediately ***notice*** in the **_current instance_** of `iTerm2` that my `theme` ***had changed***. In the ***case*** of my `.bash_profile`, I ***typed***

```shell
source ~/.bash_profile
```

to ***update*** it. OR **_completely quit_** `Terminal` and **_re-open_** **it**.

***After*** I had gotten ***half-way*** into **_Wes’_**
[course](https://commandlinepoweruser.com/), I ***became*** much more ***familiar*** with the `Z shell`, and ***realized*** that I **_hadn’t completely quit_** `Terminal` or ***updated*** my `.bash_profile` with the `source command`. So I ***did*** it, and
***this*** is ***what*** I ***subsequently got*** in `Terminal` when I **_checked_** for my ***version*** of `Ruby` AND `RVM`:

```shell
ruby -v
ruby 2.2.2p95 (2015-04-13 revision 50295) [x86_64-darwin14]

which ruby
/Users/mariacam/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.2.2/bin/ruby

rvm -v
rvm 1.28.0 (latest) by Wayne E. Seguin <wayneeseguin@gmail.com>, Michal Papis <mpapis@gmail.com> [https://rvm.io/]
```

***No more*** `problems` ***there***!

`My problems` ***weren’t*** quite ***over yet***, however. I **_still had_** the `issue` of **_not being able_** to **upgrade** `my oh-my-zsh`. That ***started*** happening **_after_** I ***installed*** `El Capitan`. ***Something happened*** to the `path` to my `oh-my-zsh` `local repository` on ***my*** `computer` when I **_upgraded_** to `El Capitan`. I ***would try*** and ***fix*** the `issue` as ***explained*** on `StackOverFlow` and ***elsewhere***, but it ***never took***. ***This*** is what ***would appear*** in `Terminal` when I ***would try*** and **_upgrade_** `oh-my-zsh`:

```shell
Upgrading Oh My Zsh
fatal: Not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git
There was an error updating. Try again later?
```

And ***when*** I ***would try*** and ***initialize*** it as a ***new*** (`local`) `git repository`, I ***would get*** the `message`:

```shell
fatal: 'origin' does not appear to be a git repository
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

Please make sure you have the correct access rights
and the repository exists.
```

***Well***, ***yesterday*** I ***tried again*** after **_fixing_** the `$PATH` **issue**. And ***this time*** it ***took***! ***This*** is ***what*** I ***did***:

```shell
git init
git remote add origin git@github.com:robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh.git
```

The `second line` ***contains*** the `SSH` for `oh-my-zsh`, ***because*** that’s ***how*** I’m ***set up*** with `Github`. I ***use*** `public` and `private` `SSH keys` to ***identify myself***, or ***rather*** `my computer`, ***with*** `Github`. If you are ***not*** `set up` ***that way***, please ***switch over***. It’s
much ***more secure*** that ***way***, and ***much less*** of a ***hassle*** in the ***long run***! To ***learn about*** `Github` and `SSH`, ***please visit*** `Github`’s ***documentation*** [Adding a new SSH key to your GitHub account](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account).

And ***my*** `initialization` ***took***! So I ***had*** to ***complete*** the `process` ***with***:

```shell
git fetch
git reset --hard origin/master
git fetch fetches the latest version of the oh-my-zsh repository on Github, and git reset --hard origin/master means

throw away all my staged and un-staged changes,
```

I ***found*** `both solutions` on `StackOverflow`. To ***read about*** the ***whole*** `oh-my-zsh` ***upgrading process fix***, ***please visit***
[Upgrading Oh My Zsh gives me ‘not a git repository’ error](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33486633/upgrading-oh-my-zsh-gives-me-not-a-git-repository-error).
To ***learn more*** about

```shell
git reset --hard origin/master
```

***please visit***
[What is the meaning of git reset –hard origin/master?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15432052/what-is-the-meaning-of-git-reset-hard-origin-master).

So ***now*** I ***have configured*** my `RVM $PATH` ***correctly*** and I ***will*** be able to **_update_** `oh-my-zsh` when ***changes*** have ***been made*** to the `remote repository`.

My ***next thing*** to ***tackle*** is `NVM` (`Node Version Manager`). Had ***similar problems*** there, ***which began*** with ***installation*** of `Node` ***way back*** when. You’ll be ***hearing*** about that ***as well***!
