## Setting up the project structure

In my `Linux Mint OS`, and `probably` many other `Linux` distros, `Python`(`3`)
comes `pre-installed`, so there is `nothing extra` to `install` for this
`particular project`.

`First`, I `created` a `folder` called `python_development` where I would `keep`
my `Python` development-related `projects`. Then, `inside` of that
`root folder`, I `created` a `folder` called `basic_python_web_server`, and
`that` is `where` my `project files` were to `reside`.

`Next`, I `created` an `index.html` file in `which` I `added` the
`following content`:

```html
<html>
	Hello, Linux Mint Developers from Python3!
</html>
```

`Next`, I `created` a `file` called `web.py` and `added` the `following code`:

```python
#
# A very simple Python HTTP server
#

import http.server
import socketserver

PORT = 8000

Handler = http.server.SimpleHTTPRequestHandler

httpd = socketserver.TCPServer(('', PORT), Handler)

print('serving at port', PORT)
httpd.serve_forever()
```

`Next`, I `ran` the `following command` to `start up` the `server` from
`Terminal`:

```shell
python3 -u web.py
```

And the `following` was `returned`:

```shell
serving at port 8000
```

`Next`, I `opened` up my `Firefox browser` and `typed` in the `following` in the
`address bar`:

```shell
# url I typed into the browser address bar
http://localhost:8000/
```

And `then` the `following text` appeared in the `browser window`:

```shell
Hello, Linux Mint Developers from Python3!
```

And that was it! I `successfully created` a `basic web` (`http`) `server` from
`Terminal` using `Python3`.

## Breaking down the code

### The SimpleHTTPServer in Python2

The `SimpleHTTPServer` module that `came` with `Python 2` was a `simple` HTTP
`server` that `provided` standard `GET` and `POST` request `handlers`. You could
easily `set up` a `server` on `localhost` to serve `files`. You could `also`
write `HTML files` and `create` a working `web application` on `localhost`.

An `advantage` of the built-in `SimpleHTTPServer` is that you `didn't` have to
`install` and `configure` anything. The `only thing` that you `needed`, was to
have `Python` installed. It was `perfect` to `use` when you `needed` a quick
`web server` running and you `didn't want` to `deal` with `setting` up `Apache`
or `Nginx-like` servers.

`SimpleHTTPServer` was a `simple` and `efficient` tool to `learn how` a `server`
or a `web app` works using `GET` and `POST` requests. You could `use` this to
`turn` any `directory` in your `system` into a `web server` directory.

`Previously`, we were `able` to run `something like` the `following` from
`Terminal` using the `SimpleHTTPServer` module:

```shell
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
```

`However`, now it `no` longer `works` that `way` with `Python3`. For me, the
`following` was `returned`:

```shell
/usr/bin/python3: No module named SimpleHTTPServer
```

### The http.server in Python3

My `Basic Python Web Server` project is `using` a `Python3` module called
`http.server`. `Similar` to `SimpleHTTPServer`, tt `allows` me to `turn` my
`project directory` into a simple `HTTP` web server.

In `Python3`, `SimpleHTTPServer` was `merged` into the `http.server` module. So
if I `wanted` to `start up` the `http.server` from `Terminal`, I would `run` the
`following command` instead:

```shell
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

To `stop` the `server`, I simply `hit` the `Control key` + `C key`.

The `http.server` module is `not recommended` for `production`. But it can
`come` in `handy` when you `want` to quickly `share files` with `students` in a
`classroom` or `others` who are `connected` to the `same network`. Or `perhaps`
you `need` to host `static resources` downloaded from the `Internet` for
`offline development`.

### The socketserver module in Python3

The `socketsever` module is a `framework` for creating `network servers`.

The `socketsever` module defines `classes` for handling
`synchronous network requests` (the `server request handler` blocks until the
`request` is `completed`) over `TCP`, `UDP`, `Unix` streams, and `Unix`
datagrams.

`Responsibility` for `processing` a `request` is `split between` a
`server class` and a `request handler class`. The `server` deals with
`communication issues` (`listing` on a `socket`, `accepting connections`, etc.)
and the `request handler` deals with `“protocol” issues` (`interpreting`
incoming `data`, `processing` it, `sending data` back to the `client`). This
`division` of `responsibility` means `that` typically you can just `use` an
existing `server class` without any `modification`, and `provide` a
`request handler class` for it to `work` with your `protocol`.

In our code,
`Responsibility for processing a request is split between a server class and a request handler class`
refers to the `following`:

```shell
# request handler class
Handler = http.server.SimpleHTTPRequestHandler
# server class
httpd = socketserver.TCPServer(('', PORT), Handler)
```

### socketsever server types

`socketserver` contains `five` different `server classes`. `BaseServer` defines
the `API`, and is `not` really `intended` to be `instantiated` and
`used directly`. `TCPServer` (which is what we are using here) uses
`TCP/IP sockets` to `communicate`. `UDPServer` uses `datagram sockets`.
`UnixStreamServer` and `UnixDatagramServer` use `Unix-domain sockets` and are
`only available` on `Unix platforms` (such as `Linux` or `macOS`).

### httpd.serve_forever() in Python3

`httpd.serve_forever()` is a `method` on the `TCPServer` instance that `starts`
the `server` and `begins listening` and `responding` to `incoming requests`.
