**Note Friday, February 10, 2023**: Soon after I joined Patreon, I **_ended_**
up **_teaching_** `JavaScript` and **_then also_** `Web Design` at `CityTech` in
**_Brooklyn_**, so the **_below_** `went` by the **_wayside_**. I am **_now
available_** for `private sessions`, (**_maybe_** the **_right_**)
`teaching opportunities`, `gigs`, or `tech related positions`.

**_Today_** is `International Women’s Day`! And it **_inspired_** me to
**_take_** my **_first steps_** in **_achieving_** my **_company’s goals_** of
**_bringing_** more **_tech awareness_** and **_efficiency_** to
`small business`.

**_More_** and **_more_** `small businesses` are **_popping up_** everywhere.
**_More_** and **_more people_** `deciding` to **_work_** for **_themselves_**
and **_not others_**. **_More_** and **_more_** `technological advances` and
**_dependence_** on `technology` **_taking place_** each day. But the **_big
question_** is, are we **_taking_** `full advantage` of **_their benefits_**?
Are we `learning` **_new things_** to **_make_** our `workflows`, `lives`
**_more efficient_**? **_After all_**, **_more efficiency_** means **_less
waste_**. **_Less waste_** means **_economical savings_**. **_Economical
savings_** in the **_end_** means **_saving money_**. We all **_know_** the
**_old adage_**, `“Time is money!”`

That’s where **_someone_** like me **_comes in_**. I **_design_**,
**_develop_**, and **_teach experiences_** that **_make_** `business workflows`
**_more efficient_**. And **_becoming_** a `creator` on `Patreon` **_allows
me_** to **_create content_** which will be **_shared exclusively_** **_with_**
my `patrons` on `Patreon`. It would **_also make_** `teaching` and
`collaborating` with `clients/patrons` much **_more flexible_**. It
**_wouldn’t_** be the **_only way_** to **_do business_** with me. It will be an
**_additional way_**!

So **_be sure_** to **_follow_** me **_there_**, and **_let_** me **_know_** the
**_things_** that you **_would find_** `beneficial` as a `patron`!
