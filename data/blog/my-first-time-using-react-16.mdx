***Yesterday*** I ***started working*** on a **_new_** **React project** which I am ***calling*** for the ***time being*** `React Universal Blog`. I ***set up*** my `basic workflow`, `directory structure`, and `files`. I ***set up*** for `Jest testing`, ***initially*** `mocking out` ***stylesheets*** and ***images*** to ***make sure*** everything was ***working properly***. Later I’ll ***switch over*** to `mocking CSS Modules`, ***because*** I ***use them*** with `POSTCSS`. It’s ***not necessary*** to ***do*** that ***unless*** you ***intend*** to ***use*** `Jest Snapshot Testing`, and I
***do***! I ***really want*** to ***check*** it ***out***, and it just ***makes sense*** when you ***do use*** `CSS Modules` in `development`.

But that’s ***not why*** I am ***writing*** this ***post***. I ***started*** this ***new project*** yesterday. And ***guess*** what ***big event*** took place ***yesterday***! `React 16.0` was ***released***! And ***guess*** what ***happened*** in ***my project***. I **_installed_** `React 16.0`.

***Before*** I ***realized*** all ***this***, I ***decided*** to ***make sure*** that my `Jest configuration`
was **_working_**, so today I ***typed*** `npm run test` in `Terminal`. This is
***what*** was ***printed out*** to the `console`:

```shell
> react-universal-blog-app@1.0.0 test /Users/mariacam/Development/react-universal-blog-app
> jest

PASS src/sum.test.js
PASS src/App.test.js
● Console

console.error node_modules/fbjs/lib/warning.js:33
Warning: React depends on requestAnimationFrame. Make sure that you load a polyfill in older browsers. http://fb.me/react-polyfills

Test Suites: 2 passed, 2 total
Tests: 2 passed, 2 total
Snapshots: 0 total

Ran all test suites.
```

***Notice*** something ***different***?

```shell
console.error node_modules/fbjs/lib/warning.js:33
Warning: React depends on requestAnimationFrame. Make sure that you load a polyfill in older browsers. http://fb.me/react-polyfills
```

***That’s*** what ***reminded me*** that `React 16.0` was ***released*** yesterday, and that ***my project*** must be ***using*** it! I ***wonder*** what other ***new goodies*** I will ***encounter***!

*Happy coding!*
