I just found out if you edit a `Twitter` **_tweet_** a **_while after_** you
have **_already_** `published` it, you **_lose_** all your `metadata`. You
**_lose_** your `likes` and `views`, **_for example_**. I **_don’t know_** about
`replies`, `retweets`, and `shares`, but **_imagine_** it have the **_same
result_**. I `edited` a `tweet` **_not_** `long after` I had **_published_** it,
but **_long enough_**. If you **_don’t want_** to **_lose_** all that
`metadata`, **_make sure_** that your `tweet` **_contains_** the `content` you
**_want_** to **_share_** from the **_get go_**. I had **_forgotten_** to
**_add_** `tags`, and **_wanted_** to **_include_** them in the `Tweet`. Was it
**_worth_** the **_loss_**? If I had **_done_** it **_much later_**, **_probably
not_**. I **_didn’t_** `lose much` **_now_**, but **_time_** will **_only
tell_** in **_this case_**.

There are **_definitely_** a **_lot_** of **_little hiccups_** and **_bugs_** in
the `Twitter UI/UX` that **_need_** to be **_addressed_** and **_fixed_**.
`Elon Musk`, **_this_** is **_one_** of **_them_**!

_Happy tweet editing!_
