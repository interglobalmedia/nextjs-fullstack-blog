## Checking for package versions in Debian based Linux distribution

In order to `check` for `package versions` in `Debian` based
`Linux distributions` such as `Ubuntu` and `Linux Mint`, etc., we can `run` the
`following commands` in `Terminal`:

```shell
dpkg -l packagename
```

Earlier today I wanted to `find out` what `version` of the `util-linux` package
I had in my `Linux Mint OS`, and I `found` the `following` on
[stackoverflow](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/713304/how-to-check-linux-util-package-version/781085?noredirect=1#comment1495057_781085):

```shell
dpkg -l util-linux
```

And it `returned` the `following` in `Terminal`:

```shell
ii  util-linux     2.37.2-4ubuntu3.4 amd64        miscellaneous system utilities
maria@maria-VirtualBox:~/Desktop/simple-http-server$ which chsh
/usr/bin/chsh
maria@maria-VirtualBox:~/Desktop/simple-http-server$ dpkg -l util-linux
Desired=Unknown/Install/Remove/Purge/Hold
| Status=Not/Inst/Conf-files/Unpacked/halF-conf/Half-inst/trig-aWait/Trig-pend
|/ Err?=(none)/Reinst-required (Status,Err: uppercase=bad)
||/ Name           Version           Architecture Description
+++-==============-=================-============-=================================
ii  util-linux     2.37.2-4ubuntu3.4 amd64        miscellaneous system utilities
```

I found this `stdout` a bit `messy`, so I `found` a `short` alternative `stdout`
of this `command`:

```shell
dpkg -l | grep util-linux
# or
dpkg-query -l | grep util-linux
```

This `returned` the `following`:

```shell
ii  util-linux                                 2.37.2-4ubuntu3.4                          amd64        miscellaneous system utilities
```

`dpkg -l | grep util-linux` is my `personal preference`, but to each his/her
own!

## Checking for the version of the util-linux package using the lsblk command

If I want to `find out` what the `package version` of `util-linux` is, of which
the `lsblk` command is a `part`, I could `find` it by `using` the `lsblk`
command `along with` the following `flag`:

```shell
lsblk --version
```

Which `returns` something like the `following`:

```shell
lsblk from util-linux 2.37.32
```

To `view` the `stackoverflow thread` where this `command` was `shared`, please
visit
[How to upgrade util-linux from 2.32.1 to 2.34 in Redhat](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72252837/how-to-upgrade-util-linux-from-2-32-1-to-2-34-in-redhat).

To `learn more` about the `lsblk` command, please visit my article entitled
[The lsblk command in Linux and what it does](/blog/the-lsblk-command-in-linux-and-what-it-does).

## Checking for the version of the util-linux package using the lsmem command

I also `came across` the `following command` on `another thread` on
[stackoverflow](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/713304/how-to-check-linux-util-package-version/781085?noredirect=1#comment1495057_781085)
`which` is `perhaps` a bit `too succinct` for me:

```shell
lsmem -V
# which returned:
lsmem from util-linux 2.37.2
```

To `learn more` about the `lsmem` command, run `man lsmem` in `Terminal`.
