## Reusing an app created in one Django project in another Django project

`I` have `created` enough `Django` apps `at` this `point` that `can` be
`reusable` in other `Django` projects `other` than `the` ones `they` were
`initially` created `in`. `It` is `smart` and `efficient development` to `be`
able `to` do `so`. `Why` re-create `something` which `already` exists
`somewhere else`? This `is` a `great path` to `creating` reusable `apps` that
`others` can also `use` in their `Django` projects. `It` also `paves` a `path`
to `writing` great `documentation` for these `apps`.

### Copying an application from one Django project into another

`Following` the
["Writing your first Django app"](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/intro/tutorial01/)
`series`, I `created` a `project` called `django_polls` inside a `top` level
`directory` called `django-polls`. This `was` all `fine`. The `app` was
`standalone`, and `that` was `great`. But `the` problems `began` when I `found`
out `about` the `Django` advanced `tutorial` called
["Advanced tutorial: How to write reusable apps"](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/intro/reusable-apps/).
I `approached` the `django_polls` project `like` I `would` any `other` with the
`naming`. `I` did `not` know `what` was `coming` up `next`, `and` neither `was`
I `appraised` of it `beforehand`.

`In` this `post`, `I` will `discuss` how `to` avoid `as` much` as` possible
`such` naming `conflicts` while` still` naming `projects` and `reusable apps`
with `professional` sounding `names`.

## Copying the polls app into a new top level directory called cast-votes

`I` arbitrarily `named` a` new` top `level` directory `cast-votes`, and `inside`
I `created` a `new` project `called` config. `I` came `across` a `number` of
`posts` and `threads` where `Django` developers `repeatedly` called `their`
projects `"config"` so `that` there `would` be `less` of a `chance` of
`naming conflicts` when `installing` reusable `apps`. I `thought` it a
`great idea`, and `decided` to `do` the `same` for the `purpose` of this `post`.
`It` looks `like` I `might` continue `to` follow this `convention`!

`You` can `follow` the `steps` to `creating` a `new project` in my `post`
entitled
[Creating the official Django Polls app Part 1](/blog/creating-the-official-django-polls-app-part-1).
`However`, this `time`, i`nstead` of `creating` a `top` level `directory` called
`django-polls`, and `then` a `project` called `django_polls`, `create` a `top`
level `directory` called `cast-vote` and a `project` called `config` inside
`cast-vote`.

`If` you `have` already `completed` the
[Creating the official Django Polls app](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/intro/tutorial01/)
`series` and `therefore` created an `app` called `polls`, `you` can `copy` the
`polls` app `directory` into the `root` of the `cast-votes` directory. There
`should` be no `conflicts`, `since` the `project name` does `not` contain
`"polls"` in it. `It's` as `generic` as `it` can `get`. `We` are `not` thinking
`about` creating a `package` from `polls` yet. `That` will `take place` in
`another post`. Right `now` we just `want` to `make sure` that our `polls` app
`can` be `reused` by `ourselves` on `our` local `machine`.

## Configuring the polls app in cast-votes

`Once` we `have` placed `polls` inside `the` top `level` cast-votes `directory`,
we `need` to `configure` it a bit. The `steps` are `not` dissimilar `from` those
`we` were `supposed` to `take` to `prepare` our `polls` app `package` in the
["Advanced tutorial: How to write reusable apps"](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/intro/reusable-apps/).

`First`, `we` have `to` add `polls` to `INSTALLED_APPS` in `config/settings.py`:

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    "django.contrib.admin",
    "django.contrib.auth",
    "django.contrib.contenttypes",
    "django.contrib.sessions",
    "django.contrib.messages",
    "django.contrib.staticfiles",
    "polls",
]
```

`Next`, we `have` to `configure` our `polls.urls` in `config/urls.py`:

```python
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import include, path # include is new

urlpatterns = [
    path("polls/", include("polls.urls")), # new
    path("admin/", admin.site.urls),
]
```

`Then`, just `make sure` that `there` isn't `anything` in your `templates` that
`does` not `belong` in `cast-votes`. I `had` a c`ouple` of `URLs` in
`templates/includes` and `templates/polls/index.html`. `Those` URLS `assumed`
that I `still` had` another` reusable `app` called `pages`, which `exists` in
the `original` django-polls `top` level `directory` along `with` the
`django_polls` project. But `since` I `haven't` added this `pages` reusable
`app` to `cast-votes`, I `had` to `make sure` to `update` them. `If`, however,
`I` did `want` to `add` that `reusable app` so `that` I `would` have a `top`
level `index page` (because right now I don't and neither should you unless you
did something different), `then` I `could` keep `those` URLs `which` were
`specific` to `django-polls/pages`. `There` were `no` other `"dependencies"` on
`django-polls`.

`If` I `were` to `package` this `app` and `publish` it, those `URLs` would
`cause` a `problem`. `The` other `question` to `ask` is, `do` we `want` to
include `templates` in our `packaged app` or `not`? `A` packaged `app` is
`going` to be `different` from a `reusable app` which `we` created `locally` on
our `machine` and `then` copied `over` to `another` Django `project`. We `have`
some `control` over its `behavior` in `relation` to the `project`, `and` in
`relation` to `other` reusable `apps` which `might` be subsequently `added`.

`According` to a `thread` on `stackoverflow` entitled
[Customize templates in a third party Django app](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38341254/customize-templates-in-a-third-party-django-app/38725452#38725452),

> You can put the template in a separate app within your project. Django looks

`This` led `me` to `the` updated `documentation` for `Django` 5.1 `entitled`
[How to override templates](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/howto/overriding-templates/):

> In your project, you might want to override a template in another Django
> application, whether it be a third-party application or a contrib application
> such as django.contrib.admin. You can either put template overrides in your
> project’s templates directory or in an application’s templates directory.

And then:

.So create an app, called e.g. social_share_templates, and put it in
INSTALLED_APPS before django_social_share. Then add the template to this folder:

```django
{{project_root}}/social_share_templates/templates/django_social_share/templatetags/post_to_facebook.html
```

And then:

> The reason your current configuration does not work, is that your local app
> has the same name as the app in site-packages. If your local app is an actual
> python module, you won't be able to use the app in site-packages. Otherwise,
> Django just looks for the templates in the app in site-packages.

And then:

> So create an app, called e.g. social_share_templates, and put it in
> INSTALLED_APPS before django_social_share. Then add the template to this
> folder:

This `issue`(s) in `the` above `thread` is `similar` to `what` I `encountered`
when `trying` to `package` an `existing` reusable `app` following
[Creating the official Django Polls app](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/intro/tutorial01/),
`among` other `things`.

`If` you `have` app and `project` templates `directories` that `both` contain
`overrides`, the `default` Django `template loader` will `try` to `load` the
`template` from the `project-level` directory `first`. `In` other `words`,
`DIRS` is `searched` before `APP_DIRS`.

`To` learn `more` about `this`, please visit
[How to override templates](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/howto/overriding-templates/)
`in` the `current` Django (5.1) `documentation`.

We `choose` third `party` packages `primarily` for their
`functionality/features`. `If` we `want` to `change` the `looks` a `bit`, we
`customize` the `templates`, `following` the `steps` described in
[How to override templates](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/howto/overriding-templates/).

`But` in my `case`, `I` just `made` a `couple` of `adjustments` to `fit` the
`app` (`module`, not `package`) `to` the `new` config `project`.

To `see` the o`riginal` django-polls `structure` containing `both` the `pages`
reusable `app` and `polls` reusable `app`, please visit
[django-polls](https://github.com/interglobalmedia/django-polls) on `Github`.

## Conclusion

`In` this `post`, I `discussed` how `I` can `reuse` an `app` created `in` one
`Django` project `in` another `project` so `that` I `don't` have to
`"re-create"` it `all` over `again` in another `project`.
