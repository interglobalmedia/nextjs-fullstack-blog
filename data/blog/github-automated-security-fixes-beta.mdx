I thought it was so cool when I stumbled across [Snyk](https://snyk.io/), a tool which "enables developers to automatically find and fix open source
vulnerabilities". However, given that we encounter myriad vulnerabilities we
have to fix each day, the monthly free tier of this tool could potentially run out very quickly. And the next tier is horribly expensive, especially for individual developers. \$599/month! Forget about it! I took my chances with the free tier.

Well, guess what? Now [Github](https://github.com/) has introduced something
called **"Automated security fixes"**.

How does [Github's](https://github.com/) automated security fixes (in beta)
work?

First of all, **public repositories** receive **security alerts** by
**_default_**. In order for **private repositories** to receive **_security
alerts_**, the owner or admin of the repository must **manually enable** the
**dependency graph** and **security alerts** in the **_repository_**.

The **_languages_** that the **dependency graph** **_supports_** are **Java**, **JavaScript**, **.NET**, **Python**, and **Ruby**. To learn more, please visit the [Github](https://github.com/) article entitled
[Listing the packages that a repository depends on](https://help.github.com/en/articles/listing-the-packages-that-a-repository-depends-on).

[Github](https://github.com/) **_does_** **state**,

> GitHub's security features, such as security alerts, do not claim to catch all vulnerabilities. Though we are always trying to update our vulnerability database and alert you with our most up-to-date information, we will not be able to catch everything or alert you to known vulnerabilities within a guaranteed time frame. These features are not substitutes for human review of each dependency for potential vulnerabilities or any other issues, and we recommend consulting with a security service or conducting a thorough vulnerability review when necessary.

Having yet another source to fix the vulnerabilities in your code is a good
thing. The more sources you can use the better. Those of us that use
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [NPM (Node Package Manager)](https://www.npmjs.com/) know that we also have `npm audit` to check and fix known vulnerabilities in our code, and [Snyk](https://snyk.io/) has been doing this kind of thing for a while, so they are another good source to glean from. I am sure there are many other similar tools out there, but I mention these because I know about them and use them. If you know of any others and would like to share them with me, feel free to ping me on **Twitter** [@letsbsocial1](https://twitter.com/letsbsocial1). That's **letsbsocial1**. And then there are always **developers** or **services** specializing in **_security_** that can **conduct** thorough **vulnerability code reviews** as well.
