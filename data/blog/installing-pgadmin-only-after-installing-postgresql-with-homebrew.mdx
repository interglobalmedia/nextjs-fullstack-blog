***[postgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)***

**Update June 17, 2018:** I ***revisited*** this ***issue*** just now and the ***set up*** really is ***easy***. I will be ***writing*** a ***post*** on this and will ***link it*** to ***here***. I ***much prefer*** using `Homebrew`***especially*** for `local development`, but I ***also like*** having the ***ability*** to ***use*** a `GUI`. This ***set set*** up just ***makes life*** so ***much easier*** if you ***want*** to ***push*** your `local repo` to ***remotes*** such as `Github`!

**Note 6.16.18:** I ***did*** `find out` ***after***, ***however***, that it can be ***very difficult***
to `set up` ***without*** the `graphical interface/server` ***installed*** with it. I ***switched over*** to the `GUI install` ***because*** I ***like*** to ***be able*** to ***go in*** there and ***take*** a `look around` ***like*** I ***do*** with `MongoDB` and as I ***had done*** with `PHPAdmin` ***back***
in ***the day***. My ***only concern*** is that ***down*** the ***line*** I will ***have issues*** with the
`Migration Assistant` when I ***get*** a ***new computer***. It was a `hell` ***when*** I ***got*** my
`current computer` ***recently***. ***That’s why*** I then ***switched*** to `Homebrew`. We ***shall see***. I ***still might*** `switch back` ***after*** I get ***more familiar*** ***with*** the `RDBMS`.

I ***recently started*** to ***learn*** `postgreSQL`, and ***installed*** it on my `0SX High Sierra` ***with*** `Homebrew`. ***Today***, I ***decided*** to ***delve*** much ***deeper*** into it and
***found*** a ***couple*** of `interesting courses` on it on
[Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/postgresql-from-zero-to-hero/). I ***hadn’t installed*** `pgAdmin` with `Homebrew` ***previously*** because it is **_severely outdated_**, but ***decided*** I ***should*** give it **_a try_** on the `pgAdmin` ***website***. I ***installed*** it and ***tried*** to ***log in***. I ***received*** the ***message*** that the **_role_** `postgres` was **_missing_**, and I ***could not*** `log in`. ***That*** is ***because*** I ***had chosen*** to ***use*** my `computer shortname` ***instead***. I ***decided*** to ***investigate*** the ***matter***.

***After*** some ***searching***, I ***came up*** with the ***following*** from **Stackoverflow**:

-   [psql: FATAL: role “postgres” does not exist](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15301826/psql-fatal-role-postgres-does-not-exist)

The ***part*** that ***worked*** `for me`, and ***should*** for ***anyone else*** in a ***similar situation***, is the ***following*** in the ***thread***:

```markdown
@RogerLipscombe if you run brew link postgresql after the installation, there's
no need to append the whole path to createuser, a simple createuser -s postgres
will work great
```

It is a `comment` ***there***, and it `worked` ***like*** a ***charm***! I ***went back*** into `pgAdmin`, the `GUI` ***recognized*** my **_new_** `postgres user`, and I ***was able*** to ***log in***.

***For me***, ***using*** `Homebrew` to ***manage*** my ***activity*** in `postgres` was the ***way*** to
***go***, but I ***also wanted*** to ***be able*** to ***go into*** the `pgAdmin GUI` and ***get*** a ***comprehensive overview*** of my ***database activity***.

*Hope `this helps`, and happy pgAdmining*!
