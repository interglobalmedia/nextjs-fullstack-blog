The ***other night*** was a ***real doozy***. I ***decided*** to ***add*** `favicons` to ***all*** my `gh-pages` ***hosted*** `projects` on `Github`. A ***while ago*** I had ***added*** a `favicon` to a `project` ***using one*** of the `images` for ***project itself*** and I had ***no problems*** after ***installation***. So ***yesterday*** I ***thought***, ***why not*** `install` a ***new*** `brand favicon` that would ***match*** the ***look*** of the ***front*** of my ***new*** `business card`? I ***wanted*** to ***get started*** on ***developing*** my ***new*** `brand image` and ***make*** it ***easy*** for ***people*** to ***recognize*** MY `work`. `Favicons` are ***great*** for ***that***.

So I ***went ahead*** and ***installed*** my ***newly generated*** `favicon` on ***all relevant*** `gh-pages-hosted` ***projects***. In the ***beginning***, ***everything*** seemed fine ***locally***. ***However***, ***once*** the `favicon` was ***pushed remotely***, ***things*** got ***hairy*** `locally` and
`remotely`. I would ***get*** an ***infinitely spinning*** `wheel` on ***page load***.

***At first*** I ***thought*** it ***might be*** the `font`. But I ***thought*** it ***couldn’t be*** the ***case***, because I ***always choose*** speedy `Google` fonts and ***never*** had ***any problems***. ***Nevertheless***, I ***tried replacing*** `one font` in a ***project*** to ***see*** what ***would happen***. It made ***no difference***. It’s ***then*** that I ***knew*** that it ***must be*** the `favicon`.

***Then*** I ***tested*** the `localhost` ***link*** in `Firefox` and the `gh-pages` ***link*** in `Firefox`. There was ***no problem*** with ***page load***. And `Safari` simply ***doesn’t display*** `favicons` ***at all***.

I ***started*** `Google Searches` for `“Favicon Bugs in Chrome”` and
`“Chrome issues favicons”`, to ***name*** a ***couple***. ***Did not*** come up with ***much*** of ***anything*** at ***first***, but it was ***only*** as I ***dug deeper*** and ***deeper***, and ***finally***
`conducted a search` entitled `“Refreshing favicons in Chrome”` that I came up with ***my solution***. It was a `StackOverflow` post ***entitled*** [“How do I force a favicon refresh”](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2208933/how-do-i-force-a-favicon-refresh)
from ***7 years ago***! The ***answer*** that ***solved*** my ***problem*** was NOT the ***most upvoted*** on the ***page*** but the ***following***:

```html
801 Ok, after 10 minutes of wtf'ing, the easy way to fix it is close to that of
lineofbirds Type in www.yoursite.com/favicon.ico (or
www.yoursite.com/apple-touch-icon.png, etc.) Push enter ctrl+f5 Restart Browser
(IE, Firefox)
```

This does **_NOT_** just apply to `IE` or `Firefox`. It ***also applies*** to
`Chrome`. But since this was ***written*** `7 years ago`, `Firefox` has ***since fixed*** its `favicon` ***bug***. It was ***only*** `Chrome` that ***caused*** me ***problems***. `Safari` ***fixed*** its ***issue*** by NOT **_displaying favicons_** AT ALL.

The `solution above` ***fixed*** my ***problem*** and I ***haven’t had*** an issue ***since***.
