**_Authenticating_** to `Github` via `HTTPS` using a `username` and `password`
is **_no longer_** a **valid way** of **_connecting_** to `Github` via the
`Command Line` (`Mac`) or `Command Prompt` (`Windows`). As of `August 13, 2021`, it has been **_replaced_** with `Personal Access Tokens`.

This **_means_** that when you **get** to **_either_** the `Git Command`
`git commit`, or if you **_manage_** to get **_past_** that one and onto
`push -u origin master` or `git push origin master`, you will **_not_** be able to `push` your **_changes_** to your `remote repository` on `Github`. This is if you are on a `Mac`.

For a **_full explanation_** of what happens when you try to **_use_** the
**_old_** `Github authentication` via `https` to **_push_** your `local commits` to your **_remote_** `Github repository`, please **_visit_** the **_following link_** on `stackoverflow`:

- [Support for password authentication was removed. Please use a personal access token instead](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68775869/support-for-password-authentication-was-removed-please-use-a-personal-access-to)

I did **_not know_** about this because I have been **using** `SSH` since the
beginning. And those of us **using** `SSH` have **_not_** been affected. This
`protocol` is **_even more_** `secure` than the `personal access token authentication`! **_However_**, I **_did walk_** a **student** on a `Mac` **_through_** this, and the `Github docs` were **_great_** about **_creating_** a `personal access token`. What we **_also did_**, which is **_not mentioned_** anywhere, but will make your life easier, is **_after_** you **_create_** the `personal access token`, and are **_ready_** to **implement** it for the **_first time_**, do it from the `Command Line`
(`Terminal`) and NOT `VS Code`â€™s `Integrated Terminal`. You **_probably_** would encounter `permission issues` there since you will **_not_** have **used** `your personal access token` **_yet_**. After you HAVE **_used_** it, it will be **_saved_** to your `keychain`, and then will **_no longer_** have `issues` with `VS Code`.

For **_those_** on `Windows OS`, it is **_much easier_**. I did **_not_** even
**_need_** to **use** a `personal access token` when **using** `VS Code` from
**_inside_** the `Integrated Terminal`. I did **_not_** write down the process
at the time, but the **_following link_** from `stackoverflow` goes into detail about the new `Github authentication` via `HTTPS` **_replacing_** the **_old one_** covering **_all_** `OS`:
