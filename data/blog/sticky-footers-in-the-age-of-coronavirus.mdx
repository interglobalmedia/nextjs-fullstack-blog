I just **_completed_** a little `local storage form` **application** for **_my students_**. I felt we **needed** something **_fun_** and **_silly_** to **uplift** our **spirits**, so I **_created_** an **application** called
`"Storage Fun With Forms"`.

I **_initially_** built it **without** a **_footer_**. I did something a bit
**_unorthodox_** with my `image`, which I knew would **_break_** the
`sticky footer` **styling** I **_normally_** **add** to my **applications**. In fact, when I **applied** it with **_no_** **adjustments**, it did **_not_** **result** in a `sticky footer`. It **_resulted in_** a `horizontal layout` **_instead_** **of** the `vertical` one I **_began with_**, and my `footer` **_ended up_** **above** the **image**. Why? Because I **_set_** the `position` of the **image** to `absolute`.

I realized pretty quickly that I would have to **_remove_** my **usual**
`sticky footer` **css**, and **_create_** **new** `css`, **emulating** the
**_effects_** of my **default** `sticky footer` **css**.

Below is the `sticky footer` **styling** I would **_normally_** **implement** in my **_applications_**:

```css
// Sticky Footer Styling
:root {
	--space: 1.5em 0;
	--space: 2em 0;
}

.Site {
	display: flex;
	flex-direction: column;
	min-height: 100vh;
}

.Site-content {
	flex: 1 0 auto;
	padding: var(--space) var(--space) 0;
	width: 100%;
}

.Site-content:after {
	content: '\00a0';
	display: block;
	margin-top: var(--space);
	height: 0;
	visibility: hidden;
}
```

The following is what **_typical_** `html` **markup** would **_look like_** in application's `index.html` when implementing the `sticky footer` **css**:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
	<head>
		<meta charset="UTF-8" />
		<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
		<title>Note App: LocalStorage vs SessionsStorage</title>
		<link
			href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Arimo&display=swap"
			rel="stylesheet"
		/>
		<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles/css/main.css" />
	</head>

	<body class="Site">
		<div class="Site-content">
			<div class="note-taker">
				<h1 class="title">Note Taker To Session Storage App</h1>
				<div class="storage-buttons">
					<a class="clear">Clear Storage</a>
					<a class="empty">Empty Storage</a>
				</div>
				<div id="storage-quota-msg"></div>
				<div class="file-save-button">
					<a id="save">Save Text To File for Download</a>
				</div>
				<div class="textarea-wrapper">
					<textarea
						name="text"
						class="session-storage"
						id="textArea"
						cols="50"
						rows="10"
					>
Hello! I love JavaScript, and I prefer sessionStorage. How about you? üëç</textarea
					>
					<button type="button" id="save-text">Save Text</button>
				</div>
			</div>
		</div>
		<footer class="site-footer">
			<script>
				const theDate = new Date()
				const footer = document.querySelector('.site-footer')
				footer.style.fontWeight = '600'
				footer.style.letterSpacing = '0.07rem'
				footer.style.fontFamily = 'Arimo, sans-serif'
				footer.innerHTML = `&#10013; ¬© ${theDate.getFullYear()} Maria D. Campbell &#10013;`
			</script>
		</footer>
		<script src="scripts/js/main.js"></script>
	</body>
</html>
```

First I **_removed_** the `markup` related to the `sticky footer` **styling**. I **_removed_** the `.Site` **class** from the `body` **tag**, and the `.Site-content` **class** from the `div` **_right below_** the `body tag`. Then I **removed** that `div` **altogether**. It **_ruined_** the `layout` I had **created** for this **application**, and I wanted to **_stay_** **with it**. There had to be another way of **achieving** a `sticky footer` using `Flexbox`. And there **_was_**!

My problem was that I **_had to_** **create** a certain amount of **extra
space** **_between_** my `form area` and the `footer`. But I had an `image` set to `position: absolute` to **_contend_** **with**. Then there was the
`responsive design` **_aspect_** to consider. In **_smaller screens_**, how was I going to **get** the **position** of the **image** to look **_relatively_** the **same** in **_different_** `viewport` **sizes**?

First I **_had_** to **make sure** that I **_added_** enough **extra space**
between the `footer` and `form` so that: 1. the footer stuck to the bottom of the document. 2. The amount of space between the form and the footer was enough to address different device heights.

This meant using `vh` instead of `%` and **_definitely not_** `px` or `rems`.

First I set

```css
display: flex;
flex-direction: column;
```

on the `body element` **selector**. But that was **_not_** **enough**. I had to figure out what `height` to **_set_** for the `footer`. I **_started_** **with** `25vh`, and **_initially_** **ended up** with what I thought was the `magic number` of `32vh`. It was **_difficult_** to **calculate** this **_scientifically_** since I was **using** `vh`. I tried, but then I decided to **_roughly_** **calculate** by **_eye_** and then test out the `footer` **vh** `calculation` in `Chrome Developer Tools` **device mode** and then in my `Google Pixel 2` **smart phone**. `32vh` wasn't too far off from my **initial calculation** of `25vh`. And it **_did not_** `mess` with my `absolutely positioned image`.

This is what my `footer` **styling** looked like at first:

```css
site-footer {
	height: 32vh;
	width: 100%;
	font-size: 100%;
	display: flex;
	justify-content: center;
	align-items: flex-end;

	@media #{$min-411} {
		font-size: 120%;
	}

	@media #{$min-600} {
		font-size: 130%;
	}
}
```

But when I **tested** in **_bigger screens_**, i.e. `1924w x 2560h` in
`Safari responsive design mode`, the `footer` did not quite make it all the way to the **bottom** of the `viewport`. I **_eyeballed_** the `viewport` again, and gave the `.site-footer` **class** a `height` of `50vh`. Then the footer **_almost stuck_** to the **bottom**. But it was **_still_** relatively **too high** and could **_not_** be **considered** a `sticky footer`. Then I changed the css to the following:

```css
site-footer {
	height: 50vh;
	width: 100%;
	font-size: 100%;
	display: flex;
	justify-content: center;
	align-items: flex-end;

	@media #{$min-411} {
		font-size: 120%;
	}

	@media #{$min-600} {
		font-size: 130%;
	}
}
```

This was **_better_**, and in **both cases**, the `icing on the cake` in the
`css`, was

```css
align-items: flex-end;
```

If I had **_not_** **added** **_that_**, the `footer` would have **shown up** **_even higher_** in the `viewport`!

For the `height` of `2560px` (derived from `responsive mode` in `Safari`), I
**_changed_** the `footer` **height** to `67vh`:

```css
.site-footer {
	height: 67vh;
}
```

But this **_did not_** **work**. **_Nothing changed_**. I had to **find** a
**solution** that **_worked_** **across** **_all_** `viewport` **heights** **_up to_** and **including** `2560px`. I decided to **_not try_** and **increase** the `footer vh` **height** **_beyond_** `50vh` using the `media query` of `min-height: 2560px`, but **_instead_** **changed** the `body>.wrapper`'s (using the `>` greater than symbol indicating that the `div` with the `.wrapper` **class** was a **_child_** of the `body element`) `margin-bottom` from an **_explicit amount_** of `6rem` to an **_explicit_** `vh` of `22vh`:

```css
body > .wrapper {
	margin-top: 9rem;
}
```

and

```css
body > .wrapper {
	margin-bottom: 22vh;
}
```

This **_DID_** work across **different** `viewport` **heights** **_up to_** and **including** the `height` of `2560px`. And I did **_not_** have to **add** another `media query` **_targeting_** the `min-height` of `2560px`.

I went this way because the `html` **markup** I had **_created_** for this
**application** was **_too complex_** and **_different_** from my **usual**
`html` **markup**. It was a **_quicker_**, **_easier_** **solution** and
delivered the **_same results_**. Given the **_current situation_**, it will
**have** to **_do_**!

The `css` is much more **_terse_** than my **original** `sticky footer` **css**, but the **_concept_** remains the **same**. To make sure that **enough space** was **_added_** between the `form` **content** and the `footer`, and that it would **_appear_** the **same** no matter what `height` the `viewport` was. BTW, I also use `vh` in my **_regular_** `sticky footer` **css**. My `.Site` **class** which I **_set_** on the `body element` in `index.html` usually **looks** like **_this_**:

```css
.Site {
	display: flex;

	flex-direction: column;

	min-height: 100vh;
}
```

Next, I had to **address** some `cross-browser` **compatibility styling**
**_issues_**. I forgot that I should **_not_** tamper with the `user agent`
**styling** of **_certain elements_**, otherwise they **_look_** **very
different** in **different browsers**. The `user agent` **styling**,
**_however_**, potentially looks **_pretty much_** the **same** across
**_browsers_**.

I **_reverted_** back to the `user agent` **styling** for the `select`
**element**. In **_addition_**, I had to **set** an **explicit width** on the `inputs` with the `color type`. Initially, I did the following with the `inputs` of `type color`:

```css
input[name='color'] {
	width: 100%;

	max-width: calc(250px - 0px);

	height: 1.5rem;
}
```

In `Chrome`, everything looked as I expected, but in `Firefox`, only a
`sliver's worth` of `color input` **width** **_showed up_**, and in `Safari`, **_no_** `color input` appeared at all. Since I had to set an **explicit width** in `pxs` or `rems`, for example, I made the `width` `200px` so that it would **_fit_** within the `body.>wrapper` in an `iphone 4` (and I didn't find it necessary to make it any bigger in wider screens). I ended up **_using_** the following `css` for my `color inputs`:

```css
input[name='color'] {
	width: 100%;
	width: 200px;
	height: 1.5rem;
	margin-top: 0.5rem;
	margin-bottom: 0.5rem;
}
```

Everything **rendered** as **_expected_** across **browsers**. You should test it out for yourself!

The other **_interesting_** **thing** I **_noticed_** was that the
`color picker` **itself** also **_somewhat_** **varied** across **browsers**. **_That_** I **could not** **_change_**. The way they **_rendered_** to the **page** did **not vary** **_drastically_**, just **_slightly_**, but there **definitely** was a **_difference_**. The look is **_most_** **similar** between `Safari` and `Chrome`. They both use the `-webkit` **vendor prefix** after all. The **_biggest_** **difference** shows up in `Firefox`, as it uses the `-moz` **vendor prefix**, and therefore its `rendering engine` **_potentially_** displays things **differently**. The `concept` that **_all browsers_** **render** things in the **_same way_** and that **all** `css` is `cross-browser` **_compatible_** is a **fallacy**! That also applies to the `user-agent` **stylesheets**.

I **_ended up_** with the **following** `css` for the `select` **element**:

```css
select {
	margin-top: 0.5rem;

	width: 200px;
	&:first-of-type {
		margin-bottom: 0.5rem;
	}
}
```

I did **_not_** make any **changes** to the `select element` except to the
`width` **property**. I **_also used_** the `select element` **selector**
instead of a `class` or `id`.

These are **_difficult_** times, and sometimes it is **difficult** to
**_focus_**. My advice: check your work even more carefully than under normal circumstances. Sometimes you might **find** **_little errors_** due to **lack** of **_focus_**, **negative distractions**, or **_due to_** one's **wandering thoughts** in **_reaction_** to the **current status** of the **_world_**. As the (`unattributable`) saying **_goes_**, `"If you‚Äôre going through hell, keep going"`. As with **_everything else_**, this **_too_** shall (eventually) **pass**. Eventually it **_will_**, so
**_don't act_** like it **won't**!
