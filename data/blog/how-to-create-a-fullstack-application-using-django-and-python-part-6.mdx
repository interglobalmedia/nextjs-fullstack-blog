## Designing the Django Boards application

### What is the purpose of Django Boards?

`Django Boards` is a `forum` where `people` come to `discuss` everything
`Django`. It's `design` and `functionality` is loosely `based` on the `official`
[Django Forum](https://www.djangoproject.com). However, the official
`Django Forum` is `NOT` built with `Django`. It is `built` with a
`forum building tool` called [Discourse](https://www.discourse.org/).

### What are the basic functionalities and structure of Django Boards?

`There` will `be` a `number` of `boards` (the `boards` app), and they will be
`analogous` to `categories`.

`Inside` the `boards` will be `topics` (`topic`), and they will be `analogous`
to `tags`. Users `start` a (`new`) `discussion` by `creating` a `new topic`.
`Inside` the `topic`, other `users` can `take part` in the `discussion` by
posting `replies` (`reply`).

### Differentiating between a standard user and the admin user

`Only` the `admin` user `will` be `able` to create `boards`, but `both` the
`standard` user and the `admin` user `will` be `able` to create `new topics` and
post `replies`.

### Use Case Diagram

`In` software `development`, a `use case` is a `concept` used to `describe` how
a `system` (or `app`, `in` this `case`) can be `used` to `achieve` specific
`goals` or `tasks`. It `outlines` the `interactions` between `users` and the
`system` (app) to `achieve` a `specific outcome`.

A `use case` diagram is a `visualization` of `those goals` or `tasks`. `Below`
is a simple `use case` diagram of the `boards` app:

![boards use case Diagram](Screenshot-2024-08-29-at-12.07.09-PM.jpg)

### Basic Class Diagram

`Class diagrams` are `used` in `software development` to `visually represent`
the `structure` and `relationships` of `classes` in a `system` (`boards` app),
i.e. `construct` and `visualize` object-oriented `systems`.

In `class diagrams`, `classes` are `depicted` as `boxes`, each `containing`
three `compartments` for the `class name`, `attributes`, and `methods`. `Lines`
connecting `classes` illustrate `associations`, showing `relationships` such as
`one-to-one` or `one-to-many`.

`In order` to `be able` to `implement` the `use cases` described, `we` will
`have` to at least `create` a `Board`, `Topic`, `Post`, and `User` model:

![Basic Class Diagram](basic_class_diagram.drawio.svg)

_Basic Class Diagram_

### Class Diagram that visualizes how the classes (models) relate to each other

Before `going` any `further` with `developing` the `code base`, we `have` to
`think` about `how` we `want` the `classes` (`models`) to `relate` to
`each other`.

-   As `indicated` by the `solid lines` in the `diagram`, in `Topic`, we `need`
    to `have` a `field` which `represents` which `Board` the `Topic` belongs
    `to`.
-   The `Post` needs to `have` a `field` to `represent` which `Topic` it
    `belongs` to. This is so `that` we could `filter` only `Posts` created
    `within` a specific `Topic` in `discussions` (replies).
-   We `need` a `field` in `Topic` representing who `started` a `discussion`.
-   We `need` a `field` in `Post` identifying who is `posting` a `reply`.

### UML Class Diagram (Unified Modeling Language)

Now I am `going` to `use` a `UML Class Diagram` to `visually represent` the
`structure` and `relationships` of our `Django Board` classes (`models`).

The `UML Class diagram` provides a `high-level` overview of the `Django Boards`
design, `helping` to `communicate` and `document` the `structure` of the
`software`. It is a `fundamental tool` in `object-oriented` design and `plays` a
crucial `role` in the `software` development `lifecycle`. `Below` is a
`UML Class diagram` of the `Django Boards` site:

![UML Class Diagram](uml_class_diagram.drawio.svg)

_UML Class Diagram_

The `lines` and `arrows` in the `diagram` will `eventually` be `translated` into
`fields` a bit `later` on.

### UML class notation

`UML class notation` is a `graphical representation` used to `depict classes`
and their `relationships` in `object-oriented` modeling.

1.  The `Class name` is `written` in the `top compartment` of the `Class box`
    and is `centered` and `bold`.
2.  The `Class attributes`, or `fields`, are `located` in the
    `second compartment` of the `Class box`, and they `represent` the
    `data members` (`data variables`) of the `Class`. They `include` the
    `visibility` (`public` or `private`) and the `data type` of each
    `attribute`.
3.  `Visibility notations` indicate the `access level` of `attributes` and
    `methods`. `Common` visibility `notations` include:
    -   `+` stands for public (visible to all classes)
    -   `-` stands for private (visible only within the class)
    -   `#` stands for private (visible only within the class)
    -   `~` stands for default visibility (visible to classes in the same
        package)

### Class Diagram relationships

![Class Diagram Relationships](class_diagram_relationships.drawio.svg)

_Class Diagram Relationships_

1. `Association`: An `association` represents a `bi-directional` relationship
   between `two classes`. It `indicates` that `instances` of `one class` are
   `connected` to `instances` of another `class`. `Associations` are typically
   `depicted` as a `solid line` connecting the `classes`, with `optional arrows`
   indicating the `direction` of the `relationship`. we have `association lines`
   in our `UML Class diagram`. It is the `solid line` connecting `Board` with
   `Topic`, `Topic` with `Post`, `Post` with `User`, and `Topic` with `User`.
2. `Directed Association`: A `directed association` represents a `relationship`
   between `two classes` where the `association` has a `direction`, `indicating`
   that `one class` is `associated` with `another` in a `specific way`. An
   `arrowhead` is `added` to the `association line` to `indicate` the
   `direction` of the `relationship`. The arrow `points` from the `class` that
   `initiates` the `association` to the `class` that is being `targeted` or
   `affected` by the `association`.

    - `Directed associations` are `used` when the `association` has a
      `specific flow` or `directionality`, such as `indicating` which `class` is
      `responsible` for `initiating` the `association` or which `class` has a
      `dependency` on `another`.

There are `other relationships` as `indicated` in the `diagram`, but `these are`
the `two` that `appear` in our `diagram`.

## Analyzing the UML Class Diagram

### Multiplicity and what it means in the UML Class Diagram

In `UML`, `multiplicity` (`represented` by `numbers`, `dots`, and `*`
(`wildcards`) in the `UML Class Diagram`) describes `how` many `instances` of
`one class` can be `connected` to an `instance` of `another class` through a
`given association`. This `relation` is often `expressed` as a `string` showing
the `lower` and `upper bounds` at the `endpoints` of a `connection`.

`As` already `mentioned`, there is a `bidirectional relationship` between the
`Board` class and the `Topic` class, the `Topic` class and the `Post`
(`Post reply`) `class`, and the `Post` (`Post reply`) `class` and the `User`
class. There is `no relationship` between the `Board` class and the `User`
class, `because` it is the `admin` user and `not` the `standard` user that can
`create` a `Board`.

-   A `Board` can have `0` ore more Topics (`0..*`), `meaning` a `Board` can
    exist `without` a `Topic`, and each `Topic` must be `associated` with a
    specific `Board` (`1`), `meaning` it `cannot` be `null`.

-   A `Topic` must be `associated` with at least `1` (the `starter Post`
    (`reply`)) or more `Posts` (`1..*`), and a `Post` (`reply`) must be
    `associated` with a `specific`, `only` one `Topic` (`1`).

-   A `Post` (reply) is `associated` with a `specific User` (the `creator` of
    the `Post reply`) (`1`), and a `User` can create `0` or more `Posts`
    (`0..*`). `That` same `Post` (reply) can be `updated` by the `same User` who
    `created` the `Post` (`reply`) or `not` updated `at all` (`0..1`).

    -   `There` is `not only` a `bidirectional association` between a `Post` and
        a `User`. There is `also` a `directed association` between `Post` and
        `User` as `indicated` by the `arrow` pointing to the `User` and
        `appended` to the `association line` between the `Post` and `User`. A
        `directed association` is only `interested` in `one side` of a
        `relationship`, the one `which` it `points` to. `In` this `case`, `it`
        is the `User` who has `edited` a `Post` (`updated_by`).

-   A `Topic` must be `started` (`created`) by a `specific User` and therefore
    `associated` with `only` that `one` specific `User`. A `User` can create `0`
    or more `Topics` (`0..*`).

## UML Class Diagram which visualizes fields (and not relationships)

`We` can `also create` a `UML Class Diagram` which `puts` an `emphasis` on
`Class fields` (a*ka* `attributes`) `instead` of `relationships`:

![UML Class Diagram Fields](uml_class_diagram_fields.drawio.svg)

_UML Class Diagram Fields_

This `Class Diagram` field `representation` is `equivalent` to the
`Class Diagram` relationships `representation`. `Both` have their `advantages`,
and I think `using` both `diagrams` is `helpful` in `gaining` a
`full understanding` the classes' `structure`.

`In` this `fields approach`, `it` is `clearer` that the `associations topic`,
`created_by`, and `updated_by` are actually `model fields` in `Post`.

In `Topic`, now `there` is a `class method` called `posts()`. `posts()` will
`implement` a `reverse relationship` **[^1]**, where `Django` will automatically
`execute` a `query` in the `database` to `return` a `list` of `all` the `Posts`
that `belong` to a `specific Topic`.

I `used` a `tool` called [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net) (`free`) to
`create` my `UML Class Diagrams`. I `like` it `a lot`, and it is `easy` to
`use`. I `came across` another `tool` for creating `UML Class Diagrams` called
[UML Board](https://www.umlboard.com/) ($4.99 in macOS App Store). `It` is a
`lightweight` graphical `UML class designer` which `gives` your `diagrams` a
nice `hand-drawn` look. It `provides` a `minimalistic` and `easy-to-use` user
`interface` with powerful `inline-editing` capabilities. `UMLBoard` is
`available` for `Windows`, `macOS` and `Linux` (via `unlock.sh`). I haven't
`checked` this `out` yet, but I am `looking forward` to `do so`. It also has
`extensive documentation`.

## Creating Wireframes to provide representations of what the Django Boards site will look like

A `wireframe` is a `rough diagram` created in the `early stages` of a
`site design` to `visualize` and `communicate` the `structure` of a `site`.

According to
[balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/learn/articles/what-are-wireframes/),

> The purpose of a wireframe is to define a skeletal layout that is easy to
> understand, and encourages iteration and feedback. Getting to agreement on a
> good interface structure is a critical part of the software design process.

It is `important` to create `wireframes` early on, as they `make` it `easy` to
`visualize` our `ideas`, but it is `also important` to `create` the
`UML Class Diagrams` in `conjunction`. If `designers` create `wireframes`
completely `independent` of the `knowledge` of the `actual functionality` (`how`
the `code` works) `of` the `site`, `problems` can `arise`. `Ideally`, either
`designers` also `have` a `working knowledge` of the `programming language`(`s`)
being `used`, or the `developers` themselves `create` the `wireframes`. `This`
is `not` necessarily a `popular opinion` or `approach`. `It` is simply `mine`.

![Boards project wireframe of the homepage listing all available boards](boards_project_homepage_wireframe.drawio.svg)

_Boards project wireframe of the homepage listing all available boards_

`If` a user `clicks` on the `Django Board` link, it should `take` the `user` to
a `list` of `all` the `topics`:

![Boards project wireframe listing all topics in the Django board](boards_project_wireframe_django_board_topics.drawio.svg)

_Boards project wireframe listing all topics in the Django board_

The `new topic` view:

_The new topic view_

The `topic view` displaying `posts` and `replies`:

![The topic view displaying posts and replies](boards_project_wireframe_django_board_new_topic_posts_and_replies.drawio.svg)

_The topic view displaying posts and replies_

The `topic view` displaying the `posting` of a `new reply`:

![The topic view displaying the posting of a new reply](boards_project_wireframe_django_board_topic_replies.drawio.svg)

_The topic reply view_

I also `used` [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net) to `create` my `wireframes`.
It's `free` and `very easy` to `use`!

## Conclusion

In this section, I went over aspects of designing Django Boards. I discussed the
basic functionalities and structure of Django Boards, the difference between a
standard and admin user, use case diagrams, UML class diagrams, Class diagram
relationships, and wireframes.

## Footnotes

**[^1]**: A `reverse relationship` in `Django` is `when` we `add` an
`extra field` called `related_name` in the `referenced` model. In our `boards`
app `models.py` file, we will `have` a `Topic` class and a `Post` class, `and`
in `order` to reference `Topic` in the `Post` class, for example, we will `add`
the `related_name` attribute (aka `reverse relationship`) in the `Post` class.

`According` to an `answer` in
the[ Django What is reverse relationship?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17328910/django-what-is-reverse-relationship)
`thread` on `stackoverflow`,

> Django, by defaults gives you a default `related_name` which is the ModelName
> (in lowercase) followed by `_set` - In this case, It would be `profile_set`
> (`post_set`), so `group.profile_set` (`topic.post_set`).
>
> However, you can override it by specifying a related_name in the ForeignKey
> field.

`In` our `case`, an `example` would be `something like` the `following`:

```python
# from the Post model in models.py in the board app
topic = models.ForeignKey(Topic, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='posts')
```
