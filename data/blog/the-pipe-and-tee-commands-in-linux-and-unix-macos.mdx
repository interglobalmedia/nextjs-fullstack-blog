I just finished a article entitled
[Using pipe (|) and grep in Linux and Unix (macOS)](http://localhost:3000/blog/using-pipe-and-grep-in-linux-and-unix-macos).
In this article, I will discuss using pipe (`|`) and `tee` in `Linux`.

As discussed in my article
[Using pipe (|) and grep in Linux and Unix (macOS)](/blog/using-pipe-and-grep-in-linux-and-unix-macos),
the pipe (`|`) command, aka `un-named pipe`, `transmits` the `output` of one
command to another command. It can `redirect stdout`, `stdin`, or `stderr` of
one process to another for further processing.

The `tee` command reads the
[stdin](/blog/stdin-stdout-and-stderr-in-linux-and-unix-macos) and writes it to
both [stdout](/blog/stdin-stdout-and-stderr-in-linux-and-unix-macos) and one or
more `files`. According to
[Geeks for Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tee-command-linux-example/),

> The (tee) command is named after the T-splitter used in plumbing.

`Geeks for Geeks` also states,

> It basically breaks the output of a program so that it can be both displayed
> and saved in a file. It does both the tasks simultaneously...

The best way to describe what tee does is by example. Let's say I ran the
following in `Terminal` from inside a `folder` called `text-files`:

```shell
ls | tee tee.txt
```

It would return the following in `Terminal`:

```shell
duplicates.txt
first-named-pipe
list-home-directory.txt
names1.txt
names2.txt
tee.txt
```

And if I ran `cat tee.txt`, the following would be returned in `Terminal`:

```shell
duplicates.txt
first-named-pipe
list-home-directory.txt
names1.txt
names2.txt
tee.txt
```

The `stdout` of the `ls` command is `"piped"` into the `tee` command via `|` as
`stdin`, and then is both `displayed` as `stdout` in `Terminal` and `written` in
`tee.txt` as `stdout`.

And if I ran the following command:

```shell
history | tee history.txt
```

Something like the following is `output` in `Terminal`:

```shell
  1 cd ..
  2 cd Desktop
  3 ls
  4 touch file1.txt
  5 vim file1.txt
  6 sudo apt install vim
  7 vim file1.txt
  8 expand file1.txt
  9 expand file1.txt > file2.txt
 10 cat file2.txt
 11 unexpand -a file2.txt
 12 mv file1.txt names1.txt

...

372 ls | tee -a names1.txt names2.txt tee.txt
373 cat tee.txt
374 ls | tee tee.txt
375 ls
376 cat tee.txt
377 history | tee history.txt
```

And the `same content` as `output` to `Terminal` is `saved` to a newly created
`file` called `history.txt`, thanks to the `tee` command.

And if I run `cat history.txt | tee history.txt history2.txt` in `Terminal`, the
exact same content as `stdout` to `Terminal` and `history.txt` is saved to a
newly created `history2.txt` file which did not previously exist, thanks to the
`tee` command.

```shell
  1 cd ..
  2 cd Desktop
  3 ls
  4 touch file1.txt
  5 vim file1.txt
  6 sudo apt install vim
  7 vim file1.txt
  8 expand file1.txt
  9 expand file1.txt > file2.txt
 10 cat file2.txt
 11 unexpand -a file2.txt
 12 mv file1.txt names1.txt

...

372 ls | tee -a names1.txt names2.txt tee.txt
373 cat tee.txt
374 ls | tee tee.txt
375 ls
376 cat tee.txt
377 history | tee history.txt
```

Let's say I ran more commands, and then wanted to append these new commands
added to `Terminal history` to the bottom of the `history.txt` file. Running
`history | tee history.txt` would erase all previous content and replace it with
the new history. In order to make sure that the new commands are appended to the
end of the file and don't overwrite its previous contents, I run the following
in `Terminal`:

```shell
history | tee -a history.txt
```

This results in the following in `Terminal`:

```shell
...

378 ls
379 cat history.txt
380 cat history.txt
381 cat history.txt
382 history | tee history.txt
```

And inside `history.txt`:

```shell
...

378 ls
379 cat history.txt
380 cat history.txt
381 cat history.txt
382 history | tee history.txt
```

The `-a` flag, aka `--append`, is analogous to the
[`output redirector append operator` (`>>`)](/blog/redirect-operators-in-linux-and-unix-macos).
It `appends` new `data` to the `end` of a `file`, thereby `not overwriting` what
is `already there`.

Let's say I run the following command in `Terminal`:

```shell
cat history.txt | tee history.txt history2.txt
```

This `command` returns the `complete contents` of `history.txt` in `Terminal`
and `copies` its `content` into a newly created `history2.txt`. And if I run
this command `again` after a bit of time and a few more commands, and add the
`-a` or `--append` flag:

```shell
cat history.txt | tee -a history.txt history2.txt
```

And then I run the following command:

```shell
wc -l history2.txt
```

it returns the following in `Terminal`:

```shell
804 history2.txt
```

And when I ran:

```shell
wc -l history.txt
```

The `wc` command finds the `number` of `lines`, `words`, `characters`, `bytes`,
and `maximum line length` of `files`, in that order.

the following is returned in `Terminal`:

```shell
804 history.txt
```

When I ran the `cat` command again, the contents of `history.txt` were appended
to its previous content, thereby doubling the number of lines in the file. The
same went for `history2.txt`. its number of files doubled as well.

If I run the following command:

```shell
wc history.txt
```

the following is returned:

```shell
804 2094 21800 history.txt
```

`804` represents the `number` of (new) `lines`, `2094` represents the `number`
of `words`, adn `21800` the `number` of `bytes`. And if I ran the following in
`Terminal`:

```shell
wc -L history.txt
```

it returns the following:

```shell
67 history.txt
```

`67` represents the `max length` or `"width"` of a line. In other words,
`67 characters` (including spaces).

There are other other options to choose from for `wc` and `tee`, and you can
learn more about them by running `man wc` and `man tee` in `Terminal`.
