## Tables not supported natively in React Markdown

Recently I was writing an article in React Markdown, and I wanted to add a
table. However, it did not render! I didn't realize until I further researched
the issue that React Markdown does not support adding tables in Markdown
natively. According to an
[issues thread](https://github.com/remarkjs/react-markdown/issues/526) in the
React Markdown Github repository from December 22, 2020,

> Tables, and all other GFM have moved to a plugin. You can see an example of
> usage with tables here: https://github.com/remarkjs/react-markdown#use and the
> note in the release notes here:

>
> The website accurately reflects that by default, react-markdown follows the
> CommonMark standard, which does not have Tables. --

I looked at the example of usage with tables, and it seemed pretty
straightforward. I followed the example and imported the `remark-gfm` npm
package into my `post-content.js file` after `installing` it. Then I added it to
the ReactMarkdown component. But it didn't work. I kept on getting
`TypeError Cannot set properties of undefined (setting 'inTable')`. I did a
Google Search and came up with a thread on stackoverflow entitled
[ReactMarkdown + remarkGfm: everything renders as expected, EXCEPT tables - typeError?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77138105/reactmarkdown-remarkgfm-everything-renders-as-expected-except-tables-typee/77172599#77172599).

First I found out that it was only with React Markdown 9.0 that I could use the
latest version of `remark-gfm`. I however, am using React Markdown 8.0.7.
According to the answer that solved my issue, React Markdown 8.0.7 works with
`remark-gfm` version `3.0.1`.

So I `uninstalled` my `current version` of `remark-gfm` with npm uninstall
remark-gfm (`gfm` stands for `Github Flavored Markdown`) and then re-installed
it with `npm i remark-gfm@3.0.1 -S`. Then I did the following inside my
post-content.js file which is the component that renders the markdown content of
my posts on this site:

```jsx
import remarkGfm from 'remark-gfm'
import rehypeRaw from 'rehype-raw'
;<ReactMarkdown
	components={customRenderers}
	rehypePlugins={[rehypeRaw]}
	remarkPlugins={[remarkGfm]}
	remarkRehypeOptions={{ passThrough: ['link'] }}
>
	{post.content}
</ReactMarkdown>
```

I also `installed` and `imported` the `rehype-raw` npm package, and passed
`options` to `remarkRehypeOptions` because in the same thread, another user
stated:

Then he `added` a `code snippet` of `how` he `added` the `two packages` to
`React Markdown`:

```jsx
<Markdown
   remarkPlugins={[remarkGfm]}
   rehypePlugins={[rehypeRaw]}
   remarkRehypeOptions={{ passThrough: ['link'] }}
    ...
```

`Basically` the `same` as the `snippet` I `shared`, and his `snippet` is `where`
I also got `guidance`.

I also `added` some `simple styling` for my `tables` in my
`post-content.module.scss` file:

```scss
/* Markdown table styling */
.content table {
	border-spacing: 0 !important;
	border-collapse: collapse !important;
	border-color: inherit !important;
	display: block !important;
	margin: 0 auto !important;
	width: 100% !important;
	max-width: 100% !important;
	overflow: auto !important;
}

.content tbody,
.content td,
.content tfoot,
.content th,
.content thead,
.content tr {
	border-color: inherit !important;
	border-style: solid !important;
	border-width: 2px !important;
	padding: 0.5rem;
}
```

if you are a `next.js` and `tailwind.css` user, I also `added` a `bit` of
`styling` for `dark mode` in my (`global`) `post-content.scss` file:

```scss
.dark .content table {
	color: $white;
}
```

This is `what` the `table` I `created` looks `like`:
