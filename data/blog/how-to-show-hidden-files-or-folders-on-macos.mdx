**_Revealing hidden files and folders in the Finder window_**

Sometimes I need to access hidden files on my laptop. They could be `SSH key`
related files or folders, various `configuration` files, `Git` related files or
folders, etc. All of these files or folders start with a `dot` (`.`).

I usually either use `VSCode` when working on projects that contain dot files or
folders, or Terminal. But not everyone uses either one, so I am going to show
how to show hidden files or folders both using the `Finder app` on `macOS` AND
`Terminal`.

## How to show hidden files or folders with a keyboard shortcut

In order to show hidden files or folders via the `Finder` app using a
`keyboard shortcut`, first I open the `Finder` in the `dock`, and then I click
on the `Macintosh HD` in the `sidebar` located under `Locations`. Then I press
the `Command key` + `Shift key` + `Period` (`.`) `key`. This results in the
following in the `Finder` window:

![Revealing hidden files and folders in the Finder window](Screenshot-2024-07-11-at-12.11.13-AM.jpg)

**_Revealing hidden files and folders in the `Finder` window_**

As you can see, the `dot` files and folders are greyed out to indicate that they
are hidden files and folders.

In order to hide those files and folders again, I just press the `Command key` +
`Shift key` + `Period` (`.`) `key` again.

## How to show and hide hidden files and folders (again) in Terminal

In order to show hidden files or folders via `Terminal`, first I open it up via
Spotlight Search. To open `Spotlight Search`, I press the `Command key` +
`Space Bar`. Then I type `"Terminal"`, and it launches on the screen.

When I have launched the `Terminal` window instance, I type the following
command in `Terminal`:

![Typing `defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles true` command in Terminal](Screenshot-2024-07-11-at-5.31.50-AM.jpg)

**_Typing `defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles true` command in
`Terminal`_**

Afterwards, I type the following:

![Typing the `killall Finder` command in Terminal](Screenshot-2024-07-11-at-5.43.27-AM.jpg)

**_Typing the `killall Finder` command in `Terminal`_**

Why the `killall Finder` command? This `refreshes` the `Finder`. If I did not
include this command, nothing would change, and the hidden files and folders
would remain hidden.

Next, I want to hide the hidden files and folders again, so first I type the
following command in `Terminal`:

![Typing `defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles false` command in Terminal](Screenshot-2024-07-11-at-5.51.24-AM.jpg)

**_Typing `defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles false` command in
`Terminal`_**

And then I type the following again to `refresh` the `Finder`:

![Typing the `killall Finder` command in Terminal](Screenshot-2024-07-11-at-6.07.11-AM.jpg)

**_Typing the `killall Finder` command in `Terminal`_**

And this results in the following in the `Finder`:

![The Finder refreshed by the `killall Finder` command](Screenshot-2024-07-11-at-5.58.08-AM.jpg)

## Bonus: creating shell scripts to show and hide hidden files and folders

I can also create `shell scripts` to reveal and hide hidden files and folders.

First, I create a file called `show_hidden_files.sh` in `Terminal` using `Vim`:

```shell
vim show_hidden_files.sh
```

This both creates and opens up a new file called `show_hidden_files.sh` in the
built-in `Vim` text editor:

![Create new file called `show_hidden_files.sh` and open it up in Vim text editor](Screenshot-2024-07-11-at-6.13.04-AM.jpg)

**_Create new file called `show_hidden_files.sh`_**

Then, after I press the `I` key to go into `INSERT` mode, I type the following
code:

![Typing the show hidden files shell script in Vim](Screenshot-2024-07-11-at-6.18.22-AM.jpg)

**_Typing the show hidden files shell script in Vim_**

Next, I press the `esc` key followed by the `Shift` key + `Colon` (`:`) `key`
and then the `X` key to save changes and exit out of `Vim`. This takes me back
to `Command Line`:

![Returning to Command Line](Screenshot-2024-07-11-at-6.22.18-AM.jpg)

**_Returning to Command Line_**

Next, I have to `change` the `permissions` for `show_hidden_files.sh`. When I
run `ls -l show_hidden_files.sh` to find out what the `default permissions` for
`show_hidden_files.sh` are, the following is returned:

![Result of running `ls -l show_hidden_files.sh` in Terminal](Screenshot-2024-07-11-at-6.27.21-AM.jpg)

**_Result of running `ls -l show_hidden_files.sh` in `Terminal`_**

`-rw-r--r--` represents first that `show_hidden_files.sh` is a file (`-`), the
`permissions` for the `owner` of the file (`rw-`), then `user groups` on my
computer (`r--`), and then `other` (`r--`). To learn more about file permissions
on macOS, please visit my article entitled
[Shell script for turning your macOS laptop's WiFi off and on](/blog/shell-script-for-turning-your-macos-laptops-wifi-off-and-on).
As for what `other` users represent, it refers to the `Guest` user and users
that only have `share permissions` on `macOS`. `Sharing only` users can access
shared files remotely, but canâ€™t log in to the computer or change settings.
`Guest` users, mostly used by tech support professsionals to access your
computer and fix issues and bugs, for example, are usually set up to allow
`guest users` to log in to your `Mac` without entering a password.
`Guest user accounts` are also used to allow a `guest user` access to
`shared folders` from another computer on your network. To learn more, please
visit the `Related Resources` section at the end of this article.

In order to `change` the `file permissions` for `show_hidden_files.sh` and give
`full permissions` (`read` (`r`), (`w`), `execute` (`e`)) to the `owner` of the
file and no permissions at all (`0`) to user groups and `"other"`, I run the
following command in `Terminal`:

```shell
chmod 700 show_hidden_files.sh
```

Applying `7` as the permission for the owner of the file means that the owner
has read, write and execute permissions on the file. Applying `0` to
`user groups` and `other` means giving `no permissions`. When I run this command
in `Terminal`, and then run `ls -l show_hidden_files.sh`, it results in the
following:

![running the `ls -l show_hidden_files.sh` in Terminal](Screenshot-2024-07-11-at-7.20.02-AM.jpg)

**_Running the `ls -l show_hidden_files.sh` in `Terminal`_**

Now I can run this `shell script` from the `Command Line`. If I want to run this
`script` without including a path to the file (meaning from another directory
other than the directory where the shell script resides), I have to run it from
within the directory where it resides:

**_Running `show_hidden_files.sh` shell script in `Terminal`_**

Now when I open the Finder window, it looks like the following:

![The Finder after running the `show_hidden_files.sh` shell script in Terminal](Screenshot-2024-07-11-at-7.40.11-AM.jpg)

**_The Finder after running the `show_hidden_files.sh` shell script in
`Terminal`_**

Next. I create a `shell script` to hide hidden folders again. Follow the steps
for creating the `show_hidden_files.sh` shell script in `Vim`, and then
`changing` its `default permissions` with the `chmod` command, but make sure to
type the following instead:

```shell
#!/bin/zsh

defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles false

killall Finder
```

Next, run the script inside of the directory where you created it. In my case, I
run it inside a folder inside my home directory (`~`) called `macos-scripting`:

**_Running the `hide_hidden_files.sh` shell script in `Terminal`_**

Then, when I open up the `Finder` app, it looks like the following:

![The Finder app after running the `hide_hidden_files.sh` shell script](Screenshot-2024-07-11-at-5.58.08-AM.jpg)

**_The Finder app after running the `hide_hidden_files.sh` shell script_**

And that is it!
