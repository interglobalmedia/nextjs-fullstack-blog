## Making and verifying digital signatures using GPG in Linux recap

In the first article of this series entitled
[Making and verifying a detached signature using a PGP key pair in Linux](/blog/making-and-verifying-a-detached-signature-using-a-pgp-key-pair-in-linux),
I discussed how to make and verify a (regular) signature using a PGP key pair. I
went over:

-   what a digital signature is, why use them,
-   the digital signature process,
-   why they should be used with PGP (or PKI, but that is outside the scope of
    this article),
-   how to create a digital signature using a PGP key pair (a form of asymmetric
    encryption),
-   why asymmetric encryption is more secure than symmetric encryption,
-   how to edit a public PGP key, how to list the public PGP keys,
-   how to delete a PGP public key uid,
-   how to create a revocation certificate for a PGP key pair and why you should
    have one,
-   how to make a signature, and how to verify it.

`In` this `article`, I `discuss` what a `detached signature` is, `how` it
`compares` to a `complete signature`, and `how` to `make` one `using` a
`PGP key pair`, and `how` to `verify` it.

## What is a detached signature?

A `detached signature` means that it is `separate` from the `file` or `data`
being `signed`. As `opposed` to a `complete signature` which contains `both` the
`original information` and the `signature`.

## Creating a detached signature using --detach-sign

If I `want` to `create` a `detached signature` for my `make_signature.txt` file,
I would `run` the `following` in `Terminal`:

```shell
# I could also use the `-b` flag instead, which is the shorthand for `--detach-sign`
gpg --detach-sign make_signature.txt
# when I hit return, the passphrase prompt appears
# after I have entered the passphrase for my PGP key pair I am using and hit "OK", I am returned to the Terminal command prompt
```

If I run the `ls` command on the `current working directory`, I will `see` that
a `new file` called `make_signature.txt.sig` has been `created`:

```shell
make_signature.txt  make_signature.txt.sig
```

## Verifying the detached signature

To `verify` the `detached signature`, I `run` the `following` in `Terminal`:

```shell
gpg --verify make_signature.txt.sig make_signature.txt
# the following is returned when I hit the `Return` key:
gpg: Signature made Sat 10 Aug 2024 04:04:06 PM EDT
gpg:                using RSA key xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
gpg: Good signature from "Maria (GPG key pair for local tesing with correct email) <amria#maria-VirtualBox>" [ultimate]
```

If the `same` file `name` as the `original` is being `used` in
`signature verification`, then I can `do` the `following` instead:

```shell
gpg --verify make_signature.txt.sig
# and the following is returned:
gpg: assuming signed data in "make_signature.txt"
gpg: Signature made Sat 10 Aug 2024 04:04:06 PM EDT
gpg;                using RSA key xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
gpg: Good signature from "Maria (GPG key pair for local tesing with correct email) <amria#maria-VirtualBox>" [ultimate]
```

## Complete signature vs detached signature

When we `create` a `"complete"` signature as we `did` with the `gpg` extension
by `executing` the command `gpg -s make_signature.txt`,

-   the make_signature.txt.gpg file is complete because we could send it to
    someone and it would be readable using GPG and our public key.
-   --sign compresses, signs and outputs the signed text in a binary format.
-   Another user has to recover the original file from the signed version. The
    resulting .gpg file contains the signed file.

When we `create` a `detached signature`,

-   both the file and detached signature are needed to verify the signature.
-   the resulting .sig won't contain the signed file only the signature.
-   The recipient would need both the original file and the signature file in
    order to both read the data and verify it.

Basically, the `question` here `is`, "Is it more important to make the data
unreadable in transit? (complete signature)" _or_ "Is it more important that the
data just be verified? (detached signature)".
