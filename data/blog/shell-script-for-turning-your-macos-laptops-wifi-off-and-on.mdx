Recently I wrote a couple of articles regarding AppleScript and an arrticle
regarding integrating an AppleScript into a zsh shell script. Now I talk about
creating a shell script in macOS that turns off and on the Wifi on my macOS
laptop.

First I create a `wifi_reset.sh` file inside a folder called macos-scripting
located at the root of my home folder (`~`):

```shell
~/ #home folder
macos-scripting/
  concatenate.sh concatenate.txt
  download_install_firefox.sh
  play_album.sh play_song.sh wifi_reset.sh
  wifi_reset.sh
```

Next, I add the `shebang` and `path` to `zsh binary` at the top of the file:

```shell
#!/bin/zsh
```

Then I add a set of comments that is sometimes referred to as a script frame or
set of commented steps that helps me better think through the code I need to
create in each step of the scripting process:

```shell
# Reset Wi Fi
# by turning it off and on again

# turn off WiFi

# wait for a few seconds

# turn on WiFi
```

First let's add the code for turning off the WiFi and break it down:

```shell
# Reset Wi Fi
# by turning it off and on again

# turn off WiFi
networksetup -setairportpower en0 off

# wait for a few seconds

# turn on WiFi
```

`networksetup` is a macOS built-in tool that controls and modifies network
settings from the command line (Terminal). Specifically, it is a configuration
tool for controlling network settings located in System Preferences.

The `-setairportpower` flag sets Wi-Fi power to either on or off. To learn more
about networksetup and its available flags, you can run `man networksetup` in
Terminal.

`en0` represents the my laptop's hardware port. It follows the
`-setairportpower` flag. However, I need to take another step via Terminal to
find out what the value of my WiFi's hardware port is. The syntax for the
`-setairportpower` flag is:

```shell
-setairportpower hardwareport on | off
```

In order to find out what the hardware port of my laptop's WiFi is, I run the
following command in Terminal:

```shell
networksetup -listallhardwareports
```

And it returns the following in Terminal:

```shell
# The ethernet addresses have been removed
Hardware Port: Ethernet Adapter (en4)
Device: en4
Ethernet Address:

Hardware Port: Ethernet Adapter (en5)
Device: en5
Ethernet Address:

Hardware Port: Ethernet Adapter (en6)
Device: en6
Ethernet Address:

Hardware Port: Thunderbolt Bridge
Device: bridge0
Ethernet Address:

Hardware Port: Wi-Fi
Device: en0
Ethernet Address:

Hardware Port: Thunderbolt 1
Device: en1
Ethernet Address:

Hardware Port: Thunderbolt 2
Device: en2
Ethernet Address:

Hardware Port: Thunderbolt 3
Device: en3
Ethernet Address:

VLAN Configurations
===================
```

The `Hardware Port: Wi-Fi` value, the value of its Device key is `en0`. So that
is what follows `networksetup -setairportpower`. And since I want to turn off my
WiFi, `off` follows `en0`.

Next, I'll add the code for turning on my WiFi again:

```shell
# Reset Wi Fi
# by turning it off and on again

# turn off WiFi
networksetup -setairportpower en0 off

# wait for a few seconds

# turn on WiFi
networksetup -setairportpower en0 on
```

I also want to set a delay between turning WiFi off and on again, so that
switching it off is actually perceptible:

```shell
# Reset Wi Fi
# by turning it off and on again

# turn off WiFi
networksetup -setairportpower en0 off

# wait for a few seconds
sleep 5

# turn on WiFi
networksetup -setairportpower en0 on
```

The macOS sleep command takes a single argument, which is the length of time
that you want to pause before restarting a process suchb as turning on the WiFi
again. Here, the length of the pause is 5 seconds.

I can also add feedback in the Terminal while the shell script is running so
that I better know what is going on. When is the Wifi turned off and when is it
turned on again? So I add the following:

```shell
# Reset Wi Fi
# by turning it off and on again

# turn off WiFi
echo "Disabling Wi-Fi"
networksetup -setairportpower en0 off

# wait for a few seconds
sleep 5

# turn on WiFi
networksetup -setairportpower en0 on
```

Now, when I run the `./wifi_reset.sh` shell script, the following is returned in
TGerminal:

```shell
Disabling Wi-Fi
Waiting...
Re-enabled Wi-Fi
```

If I removed the echo commands, nothing would be output to Terminal. I would
just have to watch the WiFi status menu icon in the Apple menu to see when the
icon transforms into a `\` (off) and then the WiFi icon again (on).

**Note**: the `echo` command outputs text that follows the command. And if you
want to output text which consists of multiple lines, you would wrap it in
double quotes.

Last but not least, I have to change my shell script file's permissions. If I
did not complete this step, by default, I would not be able to run the script:

```shell
ls -l wifi_reset.sh
-rw-r--r--  1 mariacam  staff  264 Jul  5 14:31 wifi_reset.sh
```

`-rw-` represents the permissions of the owner of the file (me). The first `-`
indicates a file, and `rw-` represents the default permissions of the owner of
the file. The owner has read (r) and write permissions, but not execute (x)
permissions. So if I try and execute the `wifi_reset.sh` without changing the
default permissions, the following is returned in Terminal:

```shell
zsh: permission denied: ./wifi_reset.sh
```

If I run the following command to change the shell script's file permissions
within the macos-scripting folder in Terminal (where the shell script resides):

```shell
chmod +x wifi_reset.sh
```

And then run the `ls -l wifi_reset.sh` command, the following is returned:

```shell
-rwxr-xr-x  1 mariacam  staff  264 Jul  5 14:31 wifi_reset.sh
```

`chmod +x` automatically adds execute permissions to the owner, groups, and
other (users) on macOS. Even though I am the only user on my computer, maybe I
still want to be extra careful and only add execute permissions to myself! In
that case, I would run the following `chmod` command instead:

```shell
chmod 700 wifi_reset.sh
```

And when I run the `ls -l wifi_reset.sh` command, it returns the following in
Terminal:

```shell
-rwx------  1 mariacam  staff  264 Jul  5 14:31 wifi_reset.sh
```

Now `groups` and `other` (`users`) don't have the default `read` (`r`) anymore.
I set all my permissions this way. It's much safer!

**Note**: the `chmod`, aka `change mode` command allows an administrator to set
or modify a file's permissions.
