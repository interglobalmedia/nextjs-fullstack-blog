I have been delving more into IT related topics lately, such as creating shell
scripts. I also decided to include the built-in VIM text editor in the shell
script creatiion process.

I first ran the following command in Terminal:

![vim command](Screenshot-2024-07-04-at-7.26.39-AM.jpg)

This opened a new shell script file in VIM. Then, by accident, I immediately
started typing `#` in the `wifi_reset.sh` inside VIM, and the following
occurred:

![VIM error when skipping insert command and type content](Screenshot-024-07-04-at-7.30.07-AM.jpg)

The reason for this error was that I didn't press the `i` key before starting to
type in the `wifi_reset.sh` file inside VIM. In order to rectify this, I hit the
`esc` key, then the shift key + `:` key followed by typing `set prompt`:

```shell
:set prompt
```

Then I hit the `i` key and was taken into insert mode:

![insert mode in VIM](Screenshot-2024-07-04-at-8.41.14-AM.jpg)

And that was it! Now I could start typing with no resultant errors.
