## Introducing the Django Admin

When we create a new project, the root project directory automatically comes
with a file called admin.py. That file includes the `django.contrib.admin` app,
which is included in INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py.

The Django Admin reads metadata from our models to provide a quick,
model-centric interface where trusted users can manage content on our site. The
Django Admin's use should be limited to being an internal management tool and
not a means to styling the frontend of a site.

We are going to use Django Admin to manage our board app boards.

## Configuring the Django Admin

### Creating the superuser

In order to create an admin user, I run the following command in Terminal:

```shell
python3 manage.py createsuperuser
```

Which for me, returns the following:

```shell
Username (leave blank to use 'mariacam'): interglobalmedia
# then:
Email address: interglobalmedia@example.com # no need for a real email for the purposes of our site at this time
# then:
Password:
Password (login):
Superuser created successfully.
```

Next, we use our new superuser account to log into the Django Admin area. It
looks like the following:

![The Django Admin login](django-admin-login.jpg)

After I add my login credentials, I am taken to the following:

![The Django Admin dashboard (interface)](django-admin-dashboard.jpg)

_The Django Admin dashboard (interface)_

This probably looks a bit different from yours. I already registered the Board,
Post, Topic, and PostLike models to the board app's admin.py. The PostLike model
is not included in Vitor Freitas'
[A Complete Beginner's Guide to Django](https://simpleisbetterthancomplex.com/series/beginners-guide/1.11/),
which my series is based on. I updated the UML Class diagrams amd wireframes to
include PostLike. I will discuss this in the next section (Part 10). Just make
sure that your Boards that your Groups and Users under
`Authentication and Authorization` appear here.

## Registering the boards app in boards/admin.py

We have to register the boards app in boards/admin/py in order for it to appear
in the Django Admin interface so that we can interact with it and manage it
there:

```python
# boards/admin.py
from django.contrib import admin
from .models import Board, Topic, Post, PostLike

# Register your models here.
admin.site.register(Board)
```

Now, when you go back to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/`, Boards should appear
under "Boards". Now we can access Boards.

## Viewing available Boards in the Django Admin Interface

To view which boards are available to us, we can go to
`http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/boards/board/` to view our list of all our boards:

As you can see below, we can add a board or delete one:

![Add or delete a board in the Admin panel](add-delete-board-admin-panel.jpg)

_Add or delete a board in the Admin panel_

## Adding a board in the Django Admin interface

If I want to add a board, after I click the Add Board + button, the following
appears:

![Add a board in the Django Admin panel](add-board-django-admin.jpg)

_Add a board in the Django Admin panel_

After I put in the board name and description, I am given three choices. I can
press the save button and just save the new board and exit out of the Add Board
interface. I can save the new board and add another one, or I can save the new
board and continue editing it. I will go with the first choice. When I save the
new board, I am taken back to the list of boards, and it looks something like
the following:

![New board added successfully](new-board-added-successfully.jpg)

_New board added successfully_

## Deleting a board in the Django Admin interface

If I want to delete a board, i select the board I want to delete, and a result,
it looks like the following:

![Selecting board for deletion](select-board-for-deletion.jpg)

_Selecting board for deletion_

Then I run the selected action to delete the selected board by pressing the "Go"
button:

![Run selected action to delete board](run-selected-action-to-delete-board.jpg)

_Run selected action to delete board_

## Conclusion

In this section, I introduced the Django Admin, configured the Django Admin by
creating a superuser, registered the boards app in boards/admin.py, added a
board in the Django Admin interface, and deleted a board in the Django Admin
interface.
