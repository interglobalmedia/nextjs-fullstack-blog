Please ***also visit*** my `post` **_entitled_**
[ESLint parsing (in React)](/posts/eslint-parsing-in-react/).

`ESlint` (***or*** some other `linting utility` of `JS/JSX`) is ***very important*** in (`code`) ***development***. I have been ***using*** it for `JavaScript` ***development*** for a very ***long time***. When ***using*** `Create React Ap`, I ***depended*** on its `code linting` ***suggestions***, and ***took*** `built in code` ***linting*** for ***granted***. Then I kind of ***slipped*** lately ***because*** I ***use*** my own **_custom_** `React workflow`. I was **_using_** `ESlint`, but ***noticed recently*** that there was **_something wrong_**
with my ***configuration*** for `React`.

***A lot*** has ***changed*** since I ***created*** my ***last*** `React workflow`. ***Then*** I was ***using*** `React 16.5+`, `Webpack 3.6`, and `Babel 6`. A month ago I ***started using*** `React 16.6.0`, `Webpack 4.3.0`, and `Babel 7`. ***Today*** I am ***using*** `React 16.6.3`, `Webpack 4.3.0`, and `Babel 7`. ***Believe me***, ***changes occurred*** between `React 16.6.0` and `16.6.3` that **_affected_** my ***updated workflow***! So that ***means*** that ***things*** were ***changing*** regarding `ESlint` ***configuration*** for `React` ***since*** I ***created*** my ***last*** `workflow` a ***year ago***, ***especially*** since it ***depends*** on `Babel` as a `parser`!

I ***decided*** to ***execute*** a `Google search` ***regarding*** `very recent` ***articles*** about `ESlint` ***configuration*** for `React`, and ***immediately found*** what I was ***looking*** for.

***Yes***, my `ESlint` ***configuration*** was ***totally wrong***! This ***means*** I ***have*** to ***go back*** and ***check*** my `ESlint` ***configs*** in other **_recent_** `React` ***applications*** and **_update_** them where **_necessary_**.

## How ESlint Should be Configured with React 16.6.3

-   ***First*** make sure that you have ***installed*** `ESlint` as a `devDependency` in
    your ***project***. `npm i eslint -D`

-   ***Then*** make sure to ***install*** the `eslint-loader` so that you can ***add*** `eslint` to your `webpack config`. `npm i eslint-loader -D`

-   ***Then*** start ***setting up*** your ***basic*** `eslint config` ***using***
    `node_modules/.bin/eslint --init`. That’s the ***same*** you ***would do*** when
    ***configuring*** `eslint` for a **_regular_** **JavaScript application**. For a
    ***step*** by ***step*** `guide`, ***please visit*** [ESlint User Guide - Getting Started](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/getting-started) and [ESLint Introduction](http://www.logicative.com/code/web-thoughts/eslint-introduction/).

-   ***After*** you ***have run*** the ***command*** `node_modules/.bin/eslint --init` ***inside*** the `root` of your ***project***, the ***following*** will ***appear*** in your `Terminal` ***window***:

```shell
How would you like to configure ESLint? (Use arrow keys)
Use a popular style guide
❯ Answer questions about your style
Inspect your JavaScript file(s)
```

I ***usually*** like to ***choose*** `Answer questions about your style`, but ***choose whatever*** you are ***most comfortable*** with.

```shell
How would you like to configure ESLint? Answer questions about your style
? Which version of ECMAScript do you use?
  ES3
  ES5
  ES2015
  ES2016
  ES2017
❯ ES2018
```

I ***like*** to ***choose*** the **latest version** of `ECMAScript`, which ***right now*** is
`ES2018`.

```shell
How would you like to configure ESLint? Answer questions about your style
? Which version of ECMAScript do you use? ES2018
? Are you using ES6 modules? (y/N)
```

***Of course*** I am ***using*** `ES6 modules`, so I ***choose*** `y`.

```shell
node_modules/.bin/eslint --init
? How would you like to configure ESLint? Answer questions about your style
? Which version of ECMAScript do you use? ES2018
? Are you using ES6 modules? Yes
? Where will your code run?
 ◉ Browser
❯◉ Node
```

I just ***choose*** `Browser` and `Node` to ***cover*** all ***my bases***. ***Why not***, right? Well, ***actually***, there is a ***reason*** for ***including*** `Node` for ***running*** my `code`. If I ***don’t include*** it, I ***would get*** the ***following*** `error`, ***for example***:

```shell
error 'process' is not defined no-undef

node_modules/.bin/eslint --init
? How would you like to configure ESLint? Answer questions about your style
? Which version of ECMAScript do you use? ES2018
? Are you using ES6 modules? Yes
? Where will your code run? Browser, Node
? Do you use CommonJS? Yes
```

`CommonJS` is ***required*** when ***using*** `require`, which is ***used only*** in `Node` now, but I ***choose*** it ***anyway*** just ***in case*** if there is a ***package*** out there that ***still requires*** `require`.

```shell
node_modules/.bin/eslint --init
? How would you like to configure ESLint? Answer questions about your style
? Which version of ECMAScript do you use? ES2018
? Are you using ES6 modules? Yes
? Where will your code run? Browser, Node
? Do you use CommonJS? Yes
? Do you use JSX? Yes
```

***Of course*** I am ***using*** `JSX` ***since*** I am ***using*** `React`, so I ***choose*** `y`.

```shell
node_modules/.bin/eslint --init
? How would you like to configure ESLint? Answer questions about your style
? Which version of ECMAScript do you use? ES2018
? Are you using ES6 modules? Yes
? Where will your code run? Browser, Node
? Do you use CommonJS? Yes
? Do you use JSX? Yes
? Do you use React? Yes
```

And ***of course*** I ***choose*** `y` for `React`!

```shell
node_modules/.bin/eslint --init
? How would you like to configure ESLint? Answer questions about your style
? Which version of ECMAScript do you use? ES2018
? Are you using ES6 modules? Yes
? Where will your code run? Browser, Node
? Do you use CommonJS? Yes
? Do you use JSX? Yes
? Do you use React? Yes
? What style of indentation do you use? (Use arrow keys)
❯ Tabs
Spaces
```

I ***find*** `tabs` ***much easier***, so I ***choose*** `Tabs`.

```shell
node_modules/.bin/eslint --init
? How would you like to configure ESLint? Answer questions about your style
? Which version of ECMAScript do you use? ES2018
? Are you using ES6 modules? Yes
? Where will your code run? Browser, Node
? Do you use CommonJS? Yes
? Do you use JSX? Yes
? Do you use React? Yes
? What style of indentation do you use? Tabs
? What quotes do you use for strings?
Double
❯ Single
```

I just ***find choosing*** `Single` for **_quotes_** more **_convenient_** and
therefore **_easier_**, so I ***choose*** `Single`.

```shell
node_modules/.bin/eslint --init
? How would you like to configure ESLint? Answer questions about your style
? Which version of ECMAScript do you use? ES2018
? Are you using ES6 modules? Yes
? Where will your code run? Browser, Node
? Do you use CommonJS? Yes
? Do you use JSX? Yes
? Do you use React? Yes
? What style of indentation do you use? Tabs
? What quotes do you use for strings? Single
? What line endings do you use? (Use arrow keys)
❯ Unix
Windows
```

I ***use*** a `Macbook Pro`, ***which means*** that I ***am on*** `Unix`, so I ***choose*** `Unix`.

```shell
node_modules/.bin/eslint --init
? How would you like to configure ESLint? Answer questions about your style
? Which version of ECMAScript do you use? ES2018
? Are you using ES6 modules? Yes
? Where will your code run? Browser, Node
? Do you use CommonJS? Yes
? Do you use JSX? Yes
? Do you use React? Yes
? What style of indentation do you use? Tabs
? What quotes do you use for strings? Single
? What line endings do you use? Unix
? Do you require semicolons? No
```

***When asked*** if I **_require_** `semicolons`, I ***choose*** `n`. We really ***don’t need*** them ***as of*** `ES6` ***anyway***. ***However***, I **_do use_** them ***because*** of ***convention*** and that it ***also defines*** the `end of a line` (***when appropriate***).

```shell
Where will your code run? Browser, Node
? Do you use CommonJS? Yes
? Do you use JSX? Yes
? Do you use React? Yes
? What style of indentation do you use? Tabs
? What quotes do you use for strings? Single
? What line endings do you use? Unix
? Do you require semicolons? No
? What format do you want your config file to be in? JSON
```

I ***choose*** `JSON` for my `config format`, but you ***choose whatever*** you are ***most comfortable*** with.

-   When I have completed my `eslint` set up successfully, the following is
    returned at the end:

```shell
The config that you've selected requires the following dependencies:

eslint-plugin-react@latest
Successfully created .eslintrc.json file in /Users/mariacam/Development/eslint-config
```

So I am ***being told*** that **_at very least_** I ***need*** to ***install*** the ***latest version*** of the `eslint-plugin-react@latest` `npm` ***package***.

-   ***Next***, you ***have*** to ***add*** the `eslint-loader` into your `Webpack config` ***file***. I have ***two*** `config` ***files***. One ***called*** `webpack.base.config.js` and one ***called*** `webpack.prod.config.js`. `webpack.prod.config.js` is ***only related*** to `production`. `webpack.base.config.js` is ***related*** to `development`, but **_also_** to `production` **_conditionally_**. ***If*** there are `configs` that are for ***development only*** but ***also need*** to be ***configured*** for `production`, they ***would appear*** in `webpack.base.config.js` ***as well***. In ***that case***, I ***use*** `ternary operators` to **_cover_** **both environments**.

-   But it ***doesn’t end*** there. We ***also have*** to ***configure*** `Babel` to ***include*** `eslint`, and `Eslint` to ***include*** `Babel`. ***Otherwise***, we ***will obtain*** `errors` ***related to*** `JSX` in `Command Line` when ***running*** our `application` in `development`. We ***need*** `Babel` to **_parse_** our **JSX**. We ***also have*** to ***take*** into ***consideration*** the ***changes*** that have ***taken place*** with ***regards*** to `Babel 7`, `React 16.6+` and `Webpack 4+`! So ***next***, I ***have*** to ***install*** the `eslint-loader` and ***add it*** to my `Webpack config`. In my `webpack.base.config.js` ***file***, I ***do*** the ***following***:

```js
rules: [{
        test: /\.js$/,
        exclude: /node_modules/,
        use: {
            loader:'babel-loader'
        }
    },
    {
        test: /\.js$/,
        exclude: /node_modules/,
        loaders: [
            'babel-loader',
            'eslint-loader'
        ]
    }],
```

-   ***Then***, in my `eslintrc.json` ***file***, I ***do*** the ***following***:

```js
"parser": "babel-eslint",
```

at the ***top*** of the ***file***. This ***means*** that I ***have*** to ***include*** the `babel-eslint` ***npm package*** so that `Babel` will **_know_** to ***parse*** my `React JSX`.

```shell
npm i babel-eslint -D
```

-  ***Next***, I ***also have*** to ***add*** the ***following*** to my `eslintrc.json` ***file***:

```js
"extends": ["eslint:recommended", "plugin:react/recommended"],
```

This ***means*** that I am ***extending*** my `eslint configuration` to ***include***
`recommendations` ***not only*** for `vanilla JavaScript`, but for `React JSX` ***as well***.

-   You can ***also*** `include` ***other*** `style guides` ***such as*** the
    [Airbnb Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript), **_very popular_** among **React developers**, if ***you like***. It is ***included*** as an
    `option` when ***initially configuring*** `Eslint`. `Airbnb` ***open sourced*** its ***own*** [ESLint configuration](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-airbnb)
    that ***everyone*** can ***use it*** in ***their*** `ESLint configuration`.

***When*** I ***finally had*** `ESlint` ***configured properly*** for `React`, I ***immediately benefitted*** from it and ***found*** an `error` in my `code` I ***never realized*** was an `error` to ***begin with***! But ***apparently***, it was ***even regarded*** as a `security risk`. And for ***those*** of ***us*** that ***know why*** `React` was ***created*** to ***begin with***, we ***know historically*** how **_serious_** `Facebook` is about `security`. I ***like*** to ***add*** `target="blank"` to ***my links*** so that when ***people visit*** a `site` of ***mine*** or a `post` and ***click*** on a `link`, they will ***be directed*** to the `link` in a ***new window*** of their `browser`. In ***this way***, they ***would easily*** be ***able*** to ***return*** to ***my*** `site` or `post`! I had been ***told*** a ***long time ago*** that ***this was*** a ***good approach***. ***Well***,
***according*** to `ESlint`, it ***recommended*** the ***following***:

```shell
ERROR in ./src/components/speech/Speech.js

/Users/mariacam/Development/speech-to-text-app/src/components/speech/Speech.js
100:29 error Using target="_blank" without rel="noopener noreferrer" is a security risk: see https://mathiasbynens.github.io/rel-noopener react/jsx-no-target-blank

1 problem (1 error, 0 warnings)
```

So I ***added*** `rel="noopener noreferrer"` to ***my*** `link`. This is just ***one tiny*** `example` of ***why*** one ***should use*** a ***popular*** and ***widely accepted*** `code linter` in ***one’s workflows***. It ***even referred*** to an `article` on the `topic` ***written*** by [Mathias Byens](https://twitter.com/mathias), a `developer` who ***works*** on the `V8 engine` at `Google` and on `ECMAScript` ***through*** their `Technical Committee 39`.

There are ***other things*** that I ***had*** to ***resolve*** as well. ***For instance***, I did ***not know*** why `describe()`, `it()`, `expect()`, etc. would ***result in*** an `error` with `Jest`. The `tests` ***would pass***
(or ***not pass***), but `describe()`, `it()`, `expect()`, etc., ***would throw*** a
`syntactical error`. ***Today*** I ***found out*** that I ***had*** to ***add*** a `configuration` to my `eslintrc.json` ***in order*** to get ***rid of*** these `errors`. I ***added*** the ***following*** to my `eslint config`:

```js
"env": {
    "browser": true,
    "commonjs": true,
    "es6": true,
    "node": true,
    "jest": true
},
```

`"jest": true` removed the `eslint` errors.

***Since*** `eslint-plugin-react@7.11.1`, if one ***does not*** `explicitly state` the
**_version_** of `React` they are ***using*** in their `eslint config`, the
***following*** `error` is ***thrown*** when ***starting up*** a `React` ***application*** `locally`:

```shell
Warning: React version not specified in eslint-plugin-react settings.
See https://github.com/yannickcr/eslint-plugin-react#configuration.
```

***In order*** to ***remove*** this ***warning***, I ***added*** the ***following*** to my `eslintrc.json`
***file***:

```js
"settings": {
    "react": {
        "pragma": "React",
        "version": "16.6.3"
     }
},
```

`"pragma"` ***refers*** to ***how*** the `compiler` (in ***our case*** `Babel`) ***should compile*** the `code` in ***my*** (`React`) ***application***. To ***learn more*** about `pragmas`, ***please visit*** [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directive_(programming)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directive_(programming)). `"version"` ***refers*** to the **_version_** of `React` I am ***using***. When this was ***added***
to the `eslint config`, the `warning` ***went away***.

***Another thing*** I ***found out*** `today` is that ***by installing*** `babel-eslint` and ***declaring*** it as ***my*** `parser` in ***my*** `eslintrc.json`, I ***remove*** the `error` that `=` is an `unexpected token`. ***For example***, the ***following*** used to ***throw*** a `syntactical error` ***for me***:

```js
state = { listening: false }
```

***After*** I ***added*** `babel-eslint` to ***my*** *workflow* and ***declared*** it as my `parser` in `eslintrc.json`, the `error` ***went away***!

You can ***take things*** a ***step further*** and ***add*** an `eslint script` in your
`package.json` so that you can ***check*** for `errors` in ***all*** your
`Javascript/React` ***related*** files ***all*** at ***once***:

```js
"scripts": {
    "lint" : "eslint ."
},
```

There are ***all sorts*** of `configurations` you can ***add*** to your `eslint config` which I ***won’t mention*** here, ***because*** I would ***end up*** going ***on*** and ***on***. ***Everyone*** has ***different needs*** and ***has*** to ***figure out*** for ***themselves*** how to ***make*** them ***happen***! But this is a ***good start*** when it ***comes*** to **_configuring_** `ESlint` for `React`. I am ***adding*** `links` to `resources` ***related*** to ***configuring*** `eslint` for
`React` at the ***end*** of this ***post***. I ***highly recommend*** `reading` ***them***. I am ***also including*** the ***link*** to my **_latest_** `React` ***application*** which **_includes_** an `eslint config` for `React`.

**_Configuring_** `ESlint` for `React` is IMPORTANT for **_improving_** your
`React` ***code***, but it **_also includes_** IMPROVING your `JavaScript`
***code***! ***This way*** you `"kill two birds with one stone"`!
