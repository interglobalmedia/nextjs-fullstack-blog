I have both `mailx` and `mutt` installed on my `Linux Mint OS`. And I just
recently found out that `emails` that were `going` to `mailx` when I `only` had
`mailx` installed are also `now going` to `mutt`.

An `important thing` to `note` about this `article`. I `discuss` using `mailx`
or `mutt` to `send messages` to `other users` on the **_local_** `Linux Mint 22`
system, which is `installed` via `VirtualBox`.

## What is mailx?

The `mailx` utility `processes` mail `messages`. Its `options` are `limited`,
and `attachments` are basically `provided` as the `body` of the `email`.
`In order` to `"save"` an `attachment`, you would `have` to literally `copy` the
`contents` of the `attachment` and `save` it to a `file` which you would `have`
to `create` and then `open` so you could `paste` the `contents` inside the
`file`. That approach is `not ideal`, is `cumbersome`, and the `process` wastes
time.

`mailx` was `good` for `email notifications` regarding `cron jobs`, but `that`
is `about it`. When I `started` deep `diving` into `GPG` (aka
`GNU Privacy Guard`) and `PGP` (aka `Pretty Good Privacy`) and
`asymmetric encryption`, `email clients` and `email attachments` became
`important`. And `that's when` I `came` across `mutt`.

`mailx` did `not` come with my `Linux Mint OS`. I `had` to `install` the
`mailutils` package to `access` the `mail` or `mailx` command.

## mutt history

`mutt` was `originally written` by `Michael Elkins` in `1995` and `released`
under the
[GNU General Public License](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License)
version 2 or any later version. mutt was `initially designed` as a
[Mail User Agent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_client), and `depended` on
a `locally` accessible `mailbox` and
[sendmail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sendmail) infrastructure.

## What is mutt?

`mutt` is a `mail user agent`.

A `mail user agent` is a `program` or `interface module` that allows users to
compose, read, and manage their email. It can be a software running on a
computer, a dedicated mail client like Outlook or Thunderbird, or a web client
accessed through a browser.

According to `man mutt`,

> mutt is a small but very powerful text based program for reading and sending
> electronic mail under unix operating systems. It includes support for color
> terminals, MIME, OpenPGP, and threaded sorting mode.

## The mutt -a and -s options

The `most` important `option` to `me` was the `ability` to attach `files` as
`email attachments` and `send` them to `others`, `and` the `ability` to
`receive` email `attachments` and actually `save them` to my `local machine`.

The `-a` option `allows` me to `attach` a `file` using `MIME` (aka
`Multi-purpose Internet Mail Extensions`) **[^1]**. And `separating` "file" and
"to-addr" `arguments` with `--` is `mandatory`. For example:

```shell
mutt -s "Sending Magdala the email_attachment.txt" -a email_attachment.txt -- magdala@maria-VirtualBox
```

The `-s` option `stands` for `Subject line`, the `-a` option `stands` for
`attachment`, and the `two hyphens`, `--`, between `email_attachment.txt` and
`magdala@maria-VirtualBox` is `mandatory` in `order` for the (above) `command`
to `work`.

## mutt features

`mutt` does `not` only `work` with `local email`. I can `configure` it to `work`
with `Gmail`, for example, and `actually` did `manage` to `authenticate` it. The
`only problem` in my `case` was that the `Gmail` I `tried` to `hook up` to
`mutt` has `thousands` of (read) `emails` in its `inbox`, so it `took forever`
for the `message headers` to `upload`. `mutt` even `crashed` a `couple` of
`times` in the process. `For` the `purposes` of my `Linux Mint OS` installed in
`VirtualBox`, `sticking` with `local` mutt `emails` works `fine` for me.

## Footnotes

**[^1]**: `MIME` (`Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions`) is an `extension` of
the original `Simple Mail Transport Protocol` (`SMTP`) email `protocol`. It
`lets` users `exchange` different kinds of `data files`, including `audio`,
`video`, `images` and `application programs`, over `email`.

**[^2]**: `CC` (`Carbon Copy`) allows someone outside of the primary recipient
to receive a copy of the email. In addition, the recipients in both the To field
(primary recipient) and the CC field are able to see each others' email address.

**[^3]**: Just like how `CC` works in an email, `BCC` (`Blind Carbon Copy`)
sends a carbon copy of the email to someone. However, in this case, BCC keeps
the carbon copy recipients private.

**[^4]**: A `message thread` is a collection of messages. The messages are
displayed in "flat" chronological order by post date or in "question-answer"
order. "question-answer" is a thread of one question followed by all answers in
in the same hierarchy.

**[^5]**: `mutt` has a few `nice features` for `handling`
[mailing lists](http://www.rdrop.com/docs/mutt/manual60.html#using_lists). In
order to take advantage of them, you must specify which addresses belong to
mailing lists, and which mailing lists you are subscribed to. Once you have done
this, the
[list-reply function](http://www.rdrop.com/docs/mutt/manual15.html#list-reply)
will work for all known lists. Additionally, when you send a message to a
subscribed list, mutt will add a Mail-Followup-To header to tell other users'
mail user agents not to send copies of replies to your personal address. Note
that the Mail-Followup-To header is a non-standard extension which is not
supported by all mail user agents. Adding it is not bullet-proof against
receiving personal CCs of list messages. Also note that the generation of the
Mail-Followup-To header is controlled by the
[$followup_to](http://www.rdrop.com/docs/mutt/manual145.html#followup_to)
configuration variable. Mutt maintains lists of known and subscribed mailing
lists. Every subscribed mailing list is known. To mark a mailing list as known,
use the `lists` command. To mark it as subscribed, use `subscribe`.

**[^6]**: `mbox` is a generic term for a family of related file formats used for
holding collections of email messages. It was first implemented in Fifth Edition
of Unix. All messages in an mbox mailbox are concatenated and stored as plain
text in a single file. Each message starts with the four characters "From"
followed by a space (the so-called "From\_ line") and the sender's email
address. RFC 4155 defines that a UTC timestamp follows after another separating
space character. Both mutt and mailx support mbox, and is why when I either use
mailx or mutt to send an email, both mutt and mailx record the emails.

**[^7]**: The `maildir` e-mail format is a common way of storing email messages
on a file system, rather than in a database. Each message is assigned a file
with a unique name, and each mail folder is a file system directory containing
these files.

**[^8]**: `MMDF` (`Multichannel Memorandum Distribution Facility`) is a
`message transfer agent` (`MTA`), a `computer program` designed to
`transmit email`.

**[^9]**: `MH` (`Message Handling`) System is a free, open source e-mail client.
It is different from almost all other mail reading systems in that, instead of a
single program, it is made from several different programs which are designed to
work from the command line on Unix-like operating systems. Another difference is
that instead of storing multiple messages in a single file, messages each have
their own file in a special directory. These design choices mean that it is very
easy to script actions on mail messages using shell scripting tools.

**[^10]**: `Delivery Status Notification` (`DSN`) or simply a bounce, is an
automated electronic mail message from a mail system informing the sender of
another message about a delivery problem. The original message is said to have
bounced.

**[^11]**: `mutt message tagging` refers to the command line equivalent of
multiselect (ctrl+click or shift+click). To tag a message, move the cursor (or
the Up or Down arrow key) to it and hit the t key. To tag a group of emails
based on a pattern, for example "Change Requests", hit capital T. You will see
at the bottom of your mutt window Tag messages matching:. Type your tag term,
hit enter, and you should see several highlighted messages now.

**[^12]**: `PGP`, or `Pretty Good Privacy`, is an encryption/decryption system
used for both sending encrypted emails, encrypting sensitive files and then
decrypting them. Since its invention back in 1991, PGP has become the de facto
standard for email security. `S/MIME`
(`Secure/Multipurpose internet Mail Extensions`) is a widely accepted protocol
for sending digitally signed and encrypted messages.

**[^13]**: `POP3` stands for `Post Office Protocol Version 3`. The `POP3`
protocol is used to provide access to the mail inbox that is stored in the email
server. `POP3` can download and delete messages. Once the `POP3 client` has
established a connection with the mail server, it can easily retrieve all
messages from the server.

**[^14]**: `IMAP` (`Internet Mail Access Protocol`) allows users to access and
maintain hierarchical collections of e-mail folders on a remote server over the
Internet.
