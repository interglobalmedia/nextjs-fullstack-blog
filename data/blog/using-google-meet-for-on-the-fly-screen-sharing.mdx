**_Recently_**, I **found** that **using** **_Discord_**’s **screen sharing**
for **_on-the-fly_ screen sharing** was a **_bust_**. It **_complicated_** both **_my life_** and the **_lives_** of my **students**. Things took **_much
longer_** to **demonstrate**, and I **wasn’t** **_always_** **able** to
**_get_** my **_point across_**, even if it **_was_** **supported** by **_slide decks_**.

So I **_searched_** for **_“absolutely free”_** **screen sharing software** we
**_could use_** in **_addition_** to **Blackboard Ultra** (**_used_** for
**official class sessions** and **office hours**). I **_wanted_** **something
simple** to **_use_** that **everyone** would **_learn_** **how** to **use**
**_immediately_** and **_would_** be **_readily available_** for **on-the-fly** **_sessions_**.

**After** **_much_ research**, I **_finally_ stumbled upon** **_Google Meet_**. **_As long as_** one has a **Gmail _account_**, one has **_access_** to this **_nifty_** **little tool**. **_Access_** to it **resides** **_right inside_** the **Gmail** **inbox**.

**Google Meet** **_started_** as a **video conferencing** **_solution_** for
**people** in **organizations** that **_use_** **G Suite**. **_Then_**,
**_late_** in **April 2020** (at the **_height_** of the **_first_**
**COVID-19** **_wave_**), **Google** **_announced_** that **Meet** would **_soon be_** **available** to **_use_** to **anyone** with an **email address** and **internet access**. The **_change_** made **Google**'s **_scalable_**, **_stable_**, and **_secure_** **modern meeting app** **_available_** to **_everyone_**.

**Google** has also **_woven_ Meet** **_connections_** into **_other_**
**apps**, **such as** **Gmail**, **Google Chat**, and **Google Classroom**.

> These interconnections give people who use Google's tools a wide range of
options for collaboration. People may select whichever tool best helps them
accomplish a task, then move from typed text to Google Meet when merited —
with all the emotion that video can convey. — [7 ways to access Google Meet: Andy Wolber](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/7-ways-to-access-google-meet/) — ***Andy Wolber, TechRepublic***

To **_start_** **video conferencing** In **Chrome** on **_your computer_**,
**_go to_** [meet.google.com](https://meet.google.com/) and **_sign in_** if
**_necessary_**. Then **_select_** **Join** or **Start a Meeting**. On a
**_mobile device_**, **_install_** the **Meet App** on **_either_** **Android** or **iOS**. When you **_want_** to **_meet_**, **_open_** the **_app_**, **_tap_** **New Meeting** to **_start_** a **session**. You can **then** **_share_** the **meeting info** with the **_people_** you **_want_** to **join**.

There are **_different_** **ways** you can access **Google Meet**.

You can **_access_ Google Meet** via **Gmail**.

You can **_access_** **Google Meet** via **Google Classroom**.

You can **_access_ Google Meet** via **Google Chat**.

You can **_access_** **Google Meet** via **Google Slides**.

You can **_access_** **Google Meet** via Your **Jamboard device**.

The **_user interface_** is so **_simple_**. It is **_so quick_** to **get up** and **running**. And it is **_forever free_**. You even can **_change_** your **background**! So if that is the **_only reason_** why you are **_using_** **Zoom** (**_other than_** **recording capabilities**, which **Google Meet** has **_as well_**, but that is a **_premium_** **feature**), then **_perhaps_** you **should** **_check out_** **Google Meet**. There is even a **White Boarding** **_capability_**, among **_other_** **things**. The **screen sharing** is **_great_**, and it is **_easy_** to **_transfer_** **screen sharing** **_from_** one person to **_another_**.
