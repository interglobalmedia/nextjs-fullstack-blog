![Change ownership](pexels-rdne-8293700.jpg)

In `Linux` and `Unix` (`macOS`), there are **_not only_** `permissions` for
`files` and `directories`, which can be `modified` with the `chmod` command, but
there are also `user ownership` that can be `modified` with the `chown` command.

The `chown` command, or `change owner`, **_allows owners_** to `change` the
`owner` of `files` and `directories`. This command is **_particularly useful_**
when `administrators` **_need_** to **_either_** `permit` or `revoke access` to
`resources`. **_In fact_**, `chmod` and `chown` would fall under the
`identity and access management` CISSP (Certified Information Systems Security
Professional) `security domain` on the `local network`.
`identity and access management` is `focused` on `access` and `authorization` to
`keep` data `secure`, by **_making sure_** `users` follow `established policies`
to `control` and `manage assets`. It is `essential` to keep an `organization`'s
`systems` and `data` as `secure` as` possible`, by **_ensuring_** `user access`
is `limited` to **_what_** `employees` **_need_**.

## Linux users and file permissions recap

Different `users` in the `Linux` (and `Unix`) `OS` **_have both_** `ownership`
and `permissions` to `ensure` that `files` are `secure` and `restrictions` are
`made` on `who` can `modify` the `contents` of `files`.

On `Linux` (and `Unix`), there is the `root user` and the `regular` or
`standard user`.

The `root user`, or `superuser`, `has access` to `all files` and `directories`
on the `OS` and `can perform` **_any_** `operation`. And `only` the `root user`
**_can change_** `rile permissions` or `ownership` **_that they_** `don't own`.

The `standard user` has `limited access` to `files` and `directories` and can
`only modify` the `files` they `own`.

`Permissions` are `used` in the `OS` to `control` what a `user` **_can do_**
`with` a `file` or `directory`. There are `three types` of `file` or
`directory permissions`: `read` (`r`), `write` (`w`), or `execute` (`x`).
However, `file permissions` **_differ somewhat_** from `directory permissions`.
To **_learn more_**, please `read` my `article` entitled
[Changing permissions using symbolic mode and numeric mode in Linux and Unix (macOS)](/blog/changing-permissions-using-symbolic-mode-and-numeric-mode-in-linux-and-unix-macos).

## Adding a new user

On my `Linux Mint/VirtualBox` instance, I only had `1 user`. In `order` to
`be able` to `change ownership` of a `file`, **_for example_**, I `needed` to
have `another user` on the `system`. In `order` **_to add_** `another user`, I
`ran` the `following` in `Terminal`:

```shell
sudo adduser magdala --home /home/magdala/
```

I **_had_** to **_use_** `sudo` because **_only_** `root` **_can_** `add`
**_another_** `user` to the `system`. `After` the `user` **_has been_**
`created`, `we` are `prompted` for a `new password` for the `new user`.

```shell
New password:
Retype new password: password created successfully

Changing the information for username
Enter the new value, or press enter for the default
Full name []: username goes here # I entered the username (first name) followed by a last name
Room Number []: # left blank
Work Phone []: # left blank
Home Phone []: # left blank
Other []: # left blank
```

And `if` I `want` to `use` a `quick way` of `checking` the `number` of `users`
that I `now have` on `my system`, I can `run` the `following` in `Terminal`:

```shell
ls /home
```

And for me, it `returns` the `following` in `Terminal`:

```shell
magdala maria
```

`Another way` of `listing` all `users` on `Linux` is the `following`:

```shell
awk -F':' '{ print $1}' /etc/passwd
```

Which `returns` something like the `following` in `Terminal`:

```shell
root
daemon
bin
sys
sync
games
man
lp
mail
news
uucp
proxy
www-data
backup
list
irc
gnats
nobody
systemd-network
systemd-resolve
messagebus
systemd-timesync
syslog
_apt
tss
rtkit
systemd-coredump
kernoops
uuidd
cups-pk-helper
lightdm
tcpdump
speech-dispatcher
avahi-autoipd
usbmux
nm-openvpn
geoclue
dnsmasq
pulse
_flatpak
avahi
saned
colord
fwupd-refresh
hplip
maria
magdala
```

This `extracts` all the `"usernames"` including `system "usernames"` from the
`/etc/passwd` file which are `located` in `field 1`.

The `-F` flag refers to `field`, and the `field delimiter` here is `':'`, which
means it is a `field separator` (`fs`) **_between_** `fields`, which `results`
in `each field` **_taking up_** `a line`.

`'{ print $1}'` means to `print` field 1 (`$1`), or the `beginning` of
`each line` in `/etc/passwd` where the `username` is `located`. `/etc/passwd` is
where the `data` is being `extracted`.

`awk`, or `gawk` (which still uses `awk` as the `command name`) in `my case`, is
a `powerful command` which is a `pattern scanning` and `processing language`.
`And` as `I state` in my `article` entitled
[Swapping columns of a text file and then joining its contents with another text file via Command Line](/blog/swapping-columns-of-a-text-file-and-then-joining-its-contents-with-another-text-file-via-command-line),

Now I was `ready `to start using `chown`!

## `chown` syntax

```shell
chown [OPTION] OWNER[:GROUP] FILE(s)
```

`option`: `represents` the `flags` one can `pass along` with `chown`. To learn
more, run `man chown` in `Terminal`.

`owner:group`: `permits` the `user` to `change ownership` for a `user` and
`group` at the `same time`. `owner` is the `username` or `ID` of the
`new owner`, and `:group` is the `new group`.

`file(s)`: `represents` the `file`(s) the `owner` wants to `change ownership`
for.

## How to use the `chown` command

Let's say I have a `file` called `chown-file.txt`, and currently the
`file ownership` and `permissions` are the `following`:

```shell
# ls -lah chown-file.txt
# returns the following in Terminal:

-rw-rw-r-- 1 maria maria 0 Jul 20 17:27 chown-file.txt
```

`I am` the `owner` of the `file`. But let's say I want to `transfer ownership`
to my `new user` with username `magdala`. I would do the following:

```shell
sudo chown -v magdala chown-file.txt
```

which `returns` the `following` in `Terminal`:

```shell
[sudo] password for maria:
changed ownership pf 'chown-file.txt' from maria ro magdala
```

If I `did` **_not_** `use` the `-v` flag, or `--verbose`, I would not get back
something like the above message describing in detail the `results` of using the
`chown` command to `change ownership` of the `chown-file.txt` file.

I `could have` also `used` the `c` flag, or `--changes`, which `outputs` the
`same information` as the `-v` flag, but `outputs information` only `when` a
`change` is `made`.

I could also `change` the `group owner` of `chown-file.txt`:

```shell
sudo chown :magdala chown-file.txt
```

which `returns` the `following` in `Terminal`:

```shell
# returns nothing because I did not use either the -c or -v flag
```

But when I **_run_** `ls -l chown-file.txt`, the `following` is `returned` in
`Terminal`:

```shell
-rw-rw-r-- 1 magdala magdala 0 Jul 20 17:27 chown-file.txt
```

`Now` the `file` is `owned` by `user magdala` and `group magdala`. I could have
`changed` the `user` **_and_** `group` all at once by doing the following:

```shell
sudo chown magdala:magdala chown-file.txt
```

## Change ownership from one particular owner to another

Another way of `changing ownership` from `one` particular `owner` to `another`
is the `following`:

```shell
sudo chown -v --from=magdala maria chown-file.txt
```

The `following` would be `returned` in `Terminal`:

```shell
changed ownership of 'chown-file.txt' from magdala to maria
```

And if I run `ls -l chown-file.txt` the `following` would be `returned` in
`Terminal`:

```shell
-rw-rw-r-- 1 maria magdala 0 Jul 20 17:27 chown-file.txt
```

## Change ownership from one particular group to another

`Another way` of `changing ownership` from one `particular group` to `another`
is the `following`:

```shell
sudo chown maria: chown-file.txt
```

And if I then run `ls -l chown-file.txt`, the `following` would be `returned` in
`Terminal`:

```shell
-rw-rw-r-- 1 maria maria 0 jul 20 17:27 chown-file.txt
```

`sudo chown maria:` results in `changing` the `owner group` to the
`default login group` for `user maria`, because I `omitted` a `group name`
**_after the_** `colon` (`:`).

If I wanted to switch back to the group `magdala`, I would `run` the `following`
in `Terminal`:

```shell
sudo chown -v :magdala chown-file.txt
```

which would `return` the `following` in `Terminal`:

```shell
changed ownership of 'chown-file.txt' from maria:maria to :magdala
```

And if I ran `ls -l chown-file.txt`, the `following` would be `returned` in
`Terminal`:

```shell
-rw-rw-r-- 1 maria magdala 0 Jul 20 17:27 chown-file.txt
```

But if I tried to **_change_** `group ownership` back to `:maria`, I had to do
it in the `following way` as `shown previously`:

```shell
sudo chown -v maria: chown-file.txt
```

or:

```shell
sudo chown -v :maria chown-file.txt
```

which `return` the `following` in `Terminal`:

```Shell
changed ownership of 'chown-file.txt' from maria:magdala to :maria
```

And when I run `ls -l chown-file.txt`, the `following` is `returned`:

```shell
-rw-rw-r-- 1 maria maria 0 Jul 20 17:27 chown-file.txt
```

## Duplicating ownership of one file onto another

We can also `duplicate` the `ownership` of one `file` onto `another` by
`running` the `following` in `Terminal`:

```shell
sudo chown -v --reference=chown-file.txt chown-file2.txt
```

which `returns` the `following` in `Terminal`:

```shell
changed ownership of 'chown-file2.txt' from maria:maria to maria:magdala
```

To `learn more` about the `chown` command, please run `man chown` in `Terminal`.

## Using `chown` to change ownership of a directory

Let's say I create a new directory called chown-directory, and then I ran
`ls -ld chown-directory` in Terminal. It would return the following:

```shell
drwxrwxr-x  2 maria maria 4096 Jul 20 22:51 chown-directory
```

Now I want to `transfer ownership` of `this directory` to user `magdala`. I
would `run` the `following` in `Terminal`:

```shell
# ~/Desktop is where I created chown-directory and from where I changed ownership as well
sudo chown -v magdala chown-directory
```

This `returned` the `following` in `Terminal`:

```shell
changed ownership of 'chown-directory' from maria to magdala
```

And after running `ls -ld chown-directory`, it `returned` the `following` in
`Terminal`:

```shell
drwxrwxr-x  magdala maria 4096 Jul 20 22:51 chown-directory
```

To `change only` the `group ownership`:

```shell
sudo chown -v :magdala chown-directory
```

To `check` this `change` of `ownership`, I run `ls -ld chown-directory` which
`results` in the `following`:

```shell
drwxrwxr-x 2 magdala magdala 4096 Jul 20 22:51 chown-directory
```

Now let's say I `create` some `files` and `folders` inside `chown-directory`.
And after that, I want to `change ownership` of the `directory` contents
`recursively`:

```shell
sudo chown -v -R magdala:magdala chown-directory
```

the `following` is `returned` in `Terminal`:

```shell
changed ownership of 'chown-directory/chown-subdirectory' from maria:maria to magdala:magdala
changed ownership of 'chown-directory/chown-file1.txt' from maria:maria to magdala:magdala
changed ownership of 'chown-directory/chownfile2.txt' from maria:maria to magdala:magdala
changed ownership of 'chown-directory' from maria:maria to magdala:magdala
```

Now I `cd` into `chown-directory`. Then, if I `try` to `create` a `file`, the
`following happens`:

```shell
touch: cannot touch 'chown-file3.txt': Permission denied
```

Next, if I try to `delete` a `file`, the `following` is `returned`:

```shell
rm chown-file2.txt
rm: remove write-protected regular empty file 'chown-file2.txt'? y
rm: cannot remove 'chown-file2.txt: Permission denied
```

Now let's say I wanted to `open` one of the `files` inside `chown-directory` and
add some content. I can't because I only have `read permissions`. And in order
to get out of Vim, I have to press the `Esc` key followed by `colon` (`:`), the
`Q` key and finally the `!` key.

There is a way of `users` **_modifying_** `other users'` `files` and
`directories` **_without_** `sudo` or being `root user`. There is `setuid` and
`setgid`. And then there is the `opposite`, `sticky bit`. These topics are
outside of the scope of this article, but I will discuss them in an upcoming
one.
