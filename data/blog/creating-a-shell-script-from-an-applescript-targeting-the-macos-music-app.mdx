I just finished writing a post entitled
[Creating an AppleScript that plays an album in the macOS Music app](/blog/creating-an-applescript-that-plays-an-album-in-the-macos-music-app)
which played an album in the macOS Music app. But I didn't want to have to type
the whole AppleScript in the Terminal each time I wanted to play that album from
the command line. Too cumbersome! So I created a shell script containing the
AppleScript I had created.

First I created the shell script file and opened it up in vim:

```shell
vim play_album.sh
```

When the `play_album.sh` file opened up in vim, I pressed the `i` key to switch
into insert mode so I could start typing my shell script. I typed the following:

```shell
#!/bin/zsh

osascript -e 'tell application "Music" to play every track of playlist "Library" whose album is "Death to Analog"'
```

After executing the shell script, the following is returned in Terminal:

```shell
Music, Music, Music, Music, Music, Music, Music, Music, Music, Music, Music, Music, Music, Music
```

Each instance of "Music" represents an album track. "Death to Analog" contains
14 tracks, so 14 instances of "Music" were returned in Terminal.

According to [loobins.io](https://www.loobins.io/binaries/osascript/),

> The osascript binary is a command-line utility included in macOS that allows
> users to run AppleScript and Open Scripting Architecture (OSA) scripts or
> commands. AppleScript is a scripting language that is designed for power users
> to automate various tasks, application actions, and to interact with the
> operating system.

The `-e` switch executes script line by line. According to `man osascript` (the
osascript manual),

> -e statement Enter one line of a script. If -e is given, osascript will not
> look for a filename in the argument list. Multiple -e options may be given to
> build up a multi-line script. Because most scripts use characters that are
> special to many shell programs (for example, AppleScript uses single and
> double quote marks, “(”, “)”, and “\*”), the statement will have to be
> correctly quoted and escaped to get it past the shell intact.

The AppleScript also has to be correctly indented when multi-line.

And that is how to integrate an AppleScript into a shell script in macOS!
