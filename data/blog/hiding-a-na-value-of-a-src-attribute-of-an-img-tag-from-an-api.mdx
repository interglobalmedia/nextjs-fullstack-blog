Don't you **_hate_** it when you **receive** an **image** from an `API` and the `value` of the `src` **attribute** is `"N/A"` (or some other similar value)?

Well, that **happened** to **me** the other day. I was **working** on **course
content** for my `Dynamic Web 1` **class** I am **teaching** at the
`New York City College of Technology` (`City Tech` in **Brooklyn**), and I
**noticed** that there were **_quite_** a **few** **_responses_** from the
`OMDB API` which **contained** `placeholder images` because there was **_no_**
`actual image` **available**.

This **kind** of **thing** really **uglifies** an **application**, and I
**wanted** to **_remove_** **them** from the `response stream` when **present**.

The **solution** is **_very_** **simple** really, and I have **_not_** come
across it anywhere yet.

Anyway, **all** you **have** to **do** is **figure out** what the `value` of the `img` **tag's** `src` **attribute** is and then **add** the **_following_** to
your `CSS`:

```css
[src='N/A'] {
	display: none;
}
```

**For** the `API` I was **working** with, the `img` **tag** `returned` from the `API` **contains** the `src` **attribute** `value` of `'N/A'`, so it was
**simple** to **set** its `display` **property** to `'none'`.

**Sometimes** a **broken** `img` **path** is **passed** as the `value` to the
`src` **attribute**, so those **_still_** **appear** with the
`alternate placeholder` **image**. In **cases** like **_that_**, you **have** to **use** a **bit** of `JavaScript`. I **use** the **_following_** **code** to **set** the **broken image's** `display` **property** to `'none'`:

```js
// remove img src broken links
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function () {
	document.querySelectorAll('img').forEach(function (img) {
		img.onerror = function () {
			this.style.display = 'none'
		}
	})
})
```

The **way** that you **can** **_quickly_** **check** whether the `code` actually **works** or **not** is by **adding** an `img` **tag** to your `html` with a **fake image**, and then **checking** whether or not the **placeholder image** of `16w x 16h` **shows up** or **not** on the **page**. For **example**, I **added** the **_following_** to my `results.ejs` **page** in my `Node.js` **application**:

```html
<img src="alt.jpg" alt />
```

And the **_following_** **showed up** in my `html` **Elements** `tab` in the
`Developer Tools Console`:

And the **page** looked like the **following** in the `browser` (**_no_**
`alternate` **default placeholder** `image`):

![screenshot of altext image successfully removed](screen-shot-2020-09-02-at-8.50.30-am.webp)

***screenshot of altext image successfully removed***

So there are **_two_** **scenarios** one **has** to **cover**. **First** is when there is **_no_** **image** **_available_**, which **can** be **solved** with **pure** `CSS`. And the **other** is **when** the `value` of the **image** `src` **attribute** is a **broken link**. That **has** to be **solved** with `JavaScript`.

## onerror property breakdown

`onerror` is a **property** of the `GlobalEventHandlers` and is an
`EventHandler` that **processes** `error` **events**.

`Error` **events** are **fired** on **_various_** **targets** for **_various_** **types** of `errors`. In **_our_** **case**, it is **due** to a **broken link** or **path** **_passed_** as a `value` of an **image** `src` **attribute**.

When an **image** **_fails_** to `load` for **whatever reason**, an `error`
**event** is **fired** on the `img` **element** that **_initiated_** the `load`, and the `onerror()` **handler** on the **element** is **invoked**.

**Basically**, I am **setting** the `onerror` **property** on the `img`
**element** and **_initializing_** its `value` with an `anonymous` **function**. It is **inside** the `body` of this **function** that I **set**
the`style.display` **property** to `'none'`.

Now **this approach** **_works_** in `Firefox` and `Chrome` just fine. But
**when** I **went** to **check it** in `Safari`, it did NOT work. A small
placeholder **image** **_still_** **appears**. That's because `Safari` does
**_not_** **support completely** the `onerror` **property**. I'm **willing** to **stick** with my **solution** for now anyway, as the **occurrence** is
**_extremely_** **low**. If I had **tried** to **replace** the `src`
**attribute** to `"N/A"` `onerror`, which **would work** in `Safari`, then I
would **end up** with **absolutely** NO IMAGES. To **_learn_** **more** about
**_which_** **browsers** are **compatible** with the `onerror` **property**,
please **visit** [quirksmode.org](http://www.quirksmode.org/dom/events/error.html).

I will be **embedding** this **episode** of **Plugging in The Holes** along with a **transcript** in the **form** of a **post** on [interglobalmedianetwork.com](https://www.interglobalmedianetwork.com/) for your **_hearing_** and **_reading_** **pleasure**. Bye for now!
