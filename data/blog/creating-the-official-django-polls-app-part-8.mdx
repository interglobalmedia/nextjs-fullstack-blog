`Now` we'll `become acquainted` with `third-party` packages. `One` of `Django`’s
appealing `features` is their `rich ecosystem` of `third-party` packages.
They’re `community` developed `packages` that `can` be `used` to quickly `add`
new `features` to an `application`.

`We` will `learn` how to `add` the `Django Debug Toolbar`, `which` is a commonly
`used` third party `package`. The `Django Debug Toolbar` has `ranked` in the
`top` three `most` used `third-party` packages in the `Django Developers Survey`
in `recent years`.

## Installing Django Debug Toolbar

The `Django Debug Toolbar` is a `useful tool` for `debugging` Django
`applications`. `It’s` a `third-party` package that is `maintained` by the
`community organization` [Django Commons](https://github.com/django-commons).
`The` toolbar `helps` us `understand` how `our` application `functions` and `to`
identify `problems`. `It` does `so` by providing `panels` that `provide` debug
`information` about `the` current `request` and `response`.

To `install` a `third-party application` like the `toolbar`, we `need` to
`install` the `package` by `running` the below `command` within an `activated`
virtual `environment`. `This` is `similar` to our `earlier` step `for`
installing `Django`:

```shell
pip install django-debug-toolbar
```

`Then`, as `before`, we `run` the following `command` to add
`django-debug-toolbar` to our `requirements.txt`:

```shell
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

`After` running `pip freeze > requirements.txt`, `we` also `have` to `add` the
`package` to our `INSTALLED_APPS` in `settings.py`:

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    # ... all other apps
    'debug_toolbar',
]
```

`Then` we `have` to `add` the `Debug` Toolbar `middleware` to our
`MIDDLEWARE setting` in `settings.py`:

```python
MIDDLEWARE = [
    # ... all other middleware
    'debug_toolbar.middleware.DebugToolbarMiddleware',
]
```

`Then` we `have` to `configure` an `INTERNAL_IPS` in `settings.py` to `allow`
the `toolbar` to be `displayed` (`typically` set to '127.0.0.1'):

```python
INTERNAL_IPS = [
    '127.0.0.1',
]
```

`Then` we `have` to `add` the `following` to `django_polls/urls.py`:

```python
import debug_toolbar

urlpatterns = [
    path('polls/', include('polls.urls')),
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('__debug__/', include(debug_toolbar.urls)),
]
```

`The` above `configuration` is `not` from the `official` Django Debug Toolbar
`documentation`. `Their` way `differs` slightly. `The` only `place` where it
`differs` is in `urls.py`.

```python
# django_polls/urls.py
rom debug_toolbar.toolbar import debug_toolbar_urls

urlpatterns = [
    # ... the rest of your URLconf goes here ...
] + debug_toolbar_urls()
```

`Either` way `works`. `Django Debug Toolbar`'s approach `follows` the
`configuration convention` for `development` environments. We `do` something
`similar` when `configuring` static `files` for `development`, `specifically`
media (images) `files`.

`If` you `want` to `learn more` about `Django Debug Toolbars`, `visit` their
`documentation` entitled
[Django Debug Toolbar Installation](https://django-debug-toolbar.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html).

## Customizing the toolbar

`We` can `further configure` the `toolbar` by `using` the `DEBUG_TOOLBAR_CONFIG`
setting. `We` can `refer` to the
[documentation](https://django-debug-toolbar.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html)
`for` the `available options`.

## Running our project in the browser

`Next`, `we` can `start` our `Django` development `server` and `access` our
`website` in a `browser`. `If` we're `accessing` the `site` from an `allowed` IP
`address` (as `specified` in `INTERNAL_IPS`), `we` should `see` the
`debug toolbar` on the `page`.

When `I` visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/polls/`, `the` browser `window` looks
`like` the `following`:

_Adding the django debug toolbar_

`Wherever` I `go` on the `site`, the `django debug toolbar` appears.

`We` also `should` be `able` to `see` the `DjDT “handle”` on the `right side` of
the `browser window` when we `browse` to http://localhost:8000/admin/. `We` can
`click` it to `open` the `debug toolbar` and `use` the `tools` in each `panel`.
`We` can `view` the
[panels documentation page](https://django-debug-toolbar.readthedocs.io/en/latest/panels.html)
`for` more `information` on `what` the `panels` show.

`When` I went `into` my `admin interface` in the `browser`, `it` looked `like`
the `following`:

![Admin interface including Django Debug Toolbar](Screenshot-2025-01-11-at-2.37.00-PM.jpg)

_Admin interface including Django Debug Toolbar_

`When` I `clicked` on `"Hide"` to `the` top `right` of the `browser window`,
`the` following `appeared`:

`When` I `clicked` on the `DJDT` box, the `Django Debug Toolbar` reappeared.

## Installing other third-party packages

`There` are `many` more `third-party` packages `which` we `can` find `using` the
`Django` resource [Django Packages](https://djangopackages.org).

`It` can be `hard` to `choose` which `third-party` packages `we` should `use`.
`It` really `depends` on our `needs` and `objectives`. `Sometimes` it’s `okay`
to `use` a `package` that’s in `alpha` stage. `Sometimes` we `need` to `know` if
it’s `production` ready. `Adam Johnson` (who's written a lot of great articles
on Django development) `has` a `blog post` regarding what `qualifies` a
`package` as `“well maintained”` entitled
[The Well-Maintained Test: 12 Questions for New Dependencies](https://adamj.eu/tech/2021/11/04/the-well-maintained-test/).
[Django Packages](https://djangopackages.org) shows `data` for some
`characteristics`, `such` as `when` a `package` was `last updated`.

`According` to
[Writing your first Django app, part 8](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/intro/tutorial08/),

> As Adam points out in his post, when the answer to one of the questions is
> “no”, that’s an opportunity to contribute.

`If` you `want` to `see` what `Django` suggests `for` next `steps`, please visit
[Writing your first Django app, part 8](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/intro/tutorial08/)
and `go down` to the `section` entitled "What's next?".

The `next` (advanced) `tutorial` suggested by `Django` after `this one` is
entitled
[How to write reusable apps](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/intro/reusable-apps/).
I `know` I `will` be `checking` it `out` to `see` if `there` is `anything` I
`haven't` yet `learned`. `I` also `have` a `series` here `on` the `site`
entitled `"How to create a fullstack application using Django and Python"` in
`which` we `write` reusable `apps`. `If` you `want` to `learn more`, please
visit
[How to create a fullstack application using Django and Python Table of Contents](http://localhost:3000/blog/how-to-create-a-fullstack-application-using-django-and-python-table-of-contents).
`I` still `have` a `couple of` more `sections` to `write` in `order` to
`complete` the `series`, `but` 33 `sections` have `already` been `completed`.
`By` the `time` you `get` to `34`, it `and` the `rest` will `already` have
`been` published. `Check` it `out`!

## Conclusion

`In` this `section`, we `installed` the `Django Debug Toolbar`, `configured` the
`toolbar` so `it` would `appear` in the `browser` when `we` ran `our`
development `server`, `learned` that `we` can `customize` the `toolbar`, `ran`
our `Django Polls` project in the `browser` to `view` the `toolbar`, were
`introduced` to `resources` where `we` could `access` other `third` party
`packages` to `use` in our `applications`, `and` were `provided` with
`next steps`.
