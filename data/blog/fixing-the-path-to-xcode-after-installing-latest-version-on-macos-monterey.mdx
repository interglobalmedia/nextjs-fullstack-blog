Today, **_after seeing_** a
[tweet](https://twitter.com/JI/status/1546948817462800384) on
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/) **_regarding_** what the **_latest version_** of [Git](https://git-scm.com/) **_had_** to **_offer_** (which I **_subsequently found_** I could **_not install_** with the **_latest version_** of `Xcode`), I **_decided_** it was **_about time_** to **_update_** `Git`. And that **_meant updating_** `Xcode` **_first_**.

I **_ran over_** to the [Apple Developer site](https://developer.apple.com/), and **_grabbed_** the **_first version_** of `Xcode` that I **_saw_**, which was `Xcode 14.0 beta`. **_Of course_** it **_took forever_** to **_download_**. **_Then_** it **_took forever_** to **_expand_** from the `.xip` **folder**. And **_then_** I **_deleted_** my **_previous version_** from `Applications`, and **_dragged over_** the **_new version_** into `Applications`. But when I **_checked_** to **_see_** whether the **_install_** was **_successful_**, it **_threw_** an `error`. An `error` which I **_knew_** meant that the **_version_** was **_incompatible_** with `Monterey`. It was **_meant_** for `Ventura`. And I **_already knew_** that my `computer` was **_too old_** and therefore **_not compatible_** with it. To **_learn more_** about `macOS ventura` and **_which_** `Mac computers` are **_compatible_** with it, please **_visit_** the **_article_** entitled [How to install the macOS Ventura public beta](https://www.theverge.com/23200261/how-to-install-macos-ventura-public-beta-backups-separate-partition-drive)
on `The Verge`. The **_publish date_** is `July 11, 2022`. **Man**, was I
**_bummed_**. And I **_knew_** what **_that meant_**. The **_time_** was
**_approaching_** to **_get_** a **_new computer_** (**laptop**)!

But **_back_** to the `subject` at **_hand_**. After **_finding out_** which
`version` of `Xcode` **_was_** `compatible` with [macOS Monterey](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/resources/), I **_went back_** into the [Apple Developer site](https://developer.apple.com/) and [downloaded Xcode version 13.4.1](https://developer.apple.com/download/all/). **_After removing_** `version 14.0` from `Applications`, **_moving_** it to the `trash`, and then **_moving_** `expanded version 13.4.1` into `Applications`, **_when_** I **_checked_** to see **_whether_** the `install` was **_successful_**, an `error` was **_thrown_**.

I **_ran_** `xcodebuild -version` to **_make sure_** that `Xcode` was
**_installed correctly_**. **_Instead_** of the **_version_** of `Xcode` that I **_installed_** `being printed` to the `Terminal console`, I **_got_** an `error` that I **_either_** had to **_change_** the `path` of my `Xcode` **_install_**, or I **_had_** to **_install_** `CLT` (`Command Line Tools`) by **_running_** the `xcode-select --install` **_command_**. I **_ran_** the `xcode-select --install` **_command_**, even though I had **_already_** done so and therefore **_no longer_** had any `CLT` **_related updates_** to **_download_**. And **_when_** I **_did so_**, I was **_prompted_** with the **_message_** that it was **_already installed_**.

I **_searched_** for the **_answer_** as to **_how_** I **_could correct_** the `path` to `Xcode` in `Applications`. I **_pretty quickly_** came up with the **_article_** entitled [Xcode-select active developer directory error](https://itecnote.com/tecnote/xcode-select-active-developer-directory-error/) on `iTecNote.com`, **_published_** on `July 11, 2022` (very recent). I **_followed_** the **_suggestion_** to **_run_** the command `sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer`, and it **_worked_** like a **_charm_**!

**_Next_**, I **_checked_** to **_make sure_** that `CLT` **_recognized_**
`Git`, so I **_ran_** `git --version` in `Terminal`. I did **_not receive_** the `version number` I was **_hoping_** for (`2.37.1`), which I **_thought_** would have **_come_** with `Xcode 14.0`.` Git version 2.32.1` was returned **_instead_**. The `version` I **_had previously_** was `2.30.1`, so **_not_** that **_great_** an `upgrade`, but **_still better_** than `2.30.1`. I **_guess_** I **_will have_** to **_wait_** a **_while_** before I am **_able_** to [`just "git push" to push new branches. No more "--set-upstream origin"`](https://twitter.com/JI/status/1546948817462800384). **_OR_** I could **_re-install_** it with `Homebrew`, which I **_found out_** has the **_absolute_** `latest version` of` Git`: `2.37.1`! That **_might be_** the **_next post_** I `write about`.

`Happy Xcoding`!
