## Setting up the database

`polls/settings.py` is a `regular` Python `module` containing `module` level
`variables` representing `Django` settings.

`By default`, `Django` uses `SQLite`, and `it` is `the` easiest `choice`,
`For example`, in my `Django Boards` application, I use `SQLite` locally, and a
`managed` PostgreSQL `database` in `production`. `However`, in my
`next project`, I `probably` will `want` to `change` my `local database` to
`PostgreSQL`.

When `starting` your `first` real `project`, however, `you` may `want` to `use`
a `more` scalable `database` like `PostgreSQL` locally, to avoid
`database-switching` headaches. I `currently` have `them` with `Django Boards`,
for instance. Right now, `when` I `work` in `development`, I `comment` out
`reference` to my `production database`, `and` in `production`, I `comment out`
my `local database`. Yes, `that` can be a `pain`!

## Setting Django Polls to my time zone

`Next`, I `want` to `add` my `time zone` to `polls/settings.py`. `By default`,
`it` is `set` to the `following`:

```python
# Internationalization
# https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/topics/i18n/
TIME_ZONE = 'UTC'
```

`But` I `wanted` to `switch` it `to` my `time zone`, `so` I `changed` it `to`
the `following`:

```python
# Internationalization
# https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/topics/i18n/
TIME_ZONE = 'US/Eastern'
```

### LANGUAGE_CODE

`By default`, my `Django` projects `set` LANGUAGE_CODE `to` the `following`:

```python
# Internationalization
# https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/topics/i18n/
LANGUAGE_CODE = 'en-us'
```

I `keep` it `that way`.

### USE_I18N

`USE_I18N` specifies whether `Django`’s translation `system` should be
`enabled`. `By default`, it is `set` to `True`:

```python
# Internationalization
# https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/topics/i18n/
USE_I18N = True
```

I `keep` it `that way`.

### USE_THOUSAND_SEPARATOR

This `setting` is `set` to `False` by `default`. `However`, it is `not` present
`by default` in `settings.py`. If `set` to `True`, `Django` will `format`
numbers `using` the `NUMBER_GROUPING` and `THOUSAND_SEPARATOR` settings.

### NUMBER_GROUPING

This `setting` is `set` to `0` by `default`. It `specifies` the `number` of
`digits` grouped `together` on the `integer part` of a `number`. `If` this
`setting` is `0` (zero), then `no grouping` will be `applied` to the `number`.
`If` this `setting` is `greater` than `0`, then `THOUSAND_SEPARATOR` will be
`used` as the `separator` between those `groups`.

Some `locales` use `non-uniform` digit `grouping`. The l`ocale-dictated` format
`has` higher `precedence` and `will` be `applied` instead.

### USE_TZ

```python
# Internationalization
# https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/topics/i18n/
USE_TZ = True
```

This `setting` is `set` to `True` by `default`. `USE_TZ` is a `boolean` that
`specifies` if `datetimes` will be `timezone-aware` by `default` or `not`. If
`this` is` set` to `True`, `Django` will `use` timezone-aware `datetimes`
internally.

When `USE_TZ` is `False`, `Django` will `use` naive `datetimes` in `local time`,
except `when` parsing `ISO 8601` formatted `strings`, `where` timezone
`information` will `always` be `retained` if `present`.

## INSTALLED_APPS

`INSTALLED_APPS` contains the `names` of all `Django` applications `that` are
`activated` in our `Django` (`Polls`) application. `Apps` can be `used` in
`multiple projects`, `and` we can `package` and `distribute` them `for use` by
`others` in their `projects`.

`By default`, `INSTALLED_APPS` contains the `following`:

```python
# Application definition

INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
]
```

1. **django.contrib.admin**: refers to the admin site.
1. **django.contrib.auth**: the authentication system.
1. **django.contrib.contenttypes**: a framework for content types.
1. **django.contrib.sessions**: a session framework.
1. **django.contrib.messages**: a messaging framework.
1. **django.contrib.staticfiles**: a framework for managing static files.

`Some` of these `applications` make `use` of `at least` one `database table`,
though, `so` we `need` to `create` the `tables` in the `database` before `we`
can `use` them. `To` do `that`, I `run` the `following command`:

```python
python3 manage.py migrate
```

`The` migrate `command` looks `at` the `INSTALLED_APPS` setting and `creates`
any `necessary` database `tables` according `to` the `database settings` in our
`mysite/settings.py` file `and` the `database migrations` shipped `with` the
`app` (we’ll cover those later). We’ll `see` a `message` for `each migration` it
`applies`. `If` you’re `interested`, `run` the `command-line client` for your
`database` (`python manage.py dbshell`) and type \dt (`PostgreSQL`),
`SHOW TABLES;` (`MariaDB, MySQL`), `.tables` (`SQLite`), or
`SELECT TABLE_NAME FROM USER_TABLES;` (`Oracle`) to `display` the `tables`
Django `created`.

`What` I `did` is first `run` the `following`:

```shell
python3 manage.py migrate # as suggested in tutorial
```

The `following` was `returned`:

```shell
Operations to perform:
  Apply all migrations: admin, auth, contenttypes, sessions
Running migrations:
  Applying contenttypes.0001_initial... OK
  Applying auth.0001_initial... OK
  Applying admin.0001_initial... OK
  Applying admin.0002_logentry_remove_auto_add... OK
  Applying admin.0003_logentry_add_action_flag_choices... OK
  Applying contenttypes.0002_remove_content_type_name... OK
  Applying auth.0002_alter_permission_name_max_length... OK
  Applying auth.0003_alter_user_email_max_length... OK
  Applying auth.0004_alter_user_username_opts... OK
  Applying auth.0005_alter_user_last_login_null... OK
  Applying auth.0006_require_contenttypes_0002... OK
  Applying auth.0007_alter_validators_add_error_messages... OK
  Applying auth.0008_alter_user_username_max_length... OK
  Applying auth.0009_alter_user_last_name_max_length... OK
  Applying auth.0010_alter_group_name_max_length... OK
  Applying auth.0011_update_proxy_permissions... OK
  Applying auth.0012_alter_user_first_name_max_length... OK
  Applying sessions.0001_initial... OK
```

`Then` I `ran` the `following`:

```shell
python3 manage.py dbshell
```

This `lets` me `peak` into the `db.sqlite3` database. It `returns` something
`like` the `following`:

```shell
SQLite version 3.43.2 2023-10-10 13:08:14
Enter ".help" for usage hints.
sqlite>
```

`If` I `wanted` to `see` what `tables` I `have` in the `database`, `I` would
`run` the `following`;

```shell
sqlite> .tables
```

`For me`, this `returned` the `following`:

```shell
auth_group                  auth_user_user_permissions
auth_group_permissions      django_admin_log
auth_permission             django_content_type
auth_user                   django_migrations
auth_user_groups            django_session
sqlite>
```

`If` I `ran` the `following`:

```shell
sqlite> .table
```

`It` would `return` the `following`:

```shell
auth_group                  auth_user_user_permissions
auth_group_permissions      django_admin_log
auth_permission             django_content_type
auth_user                   django_migrations
auth_user_groups            django_session
sqlite>
```

## Creating the models

`In` our `Django Polls` app, `we` will `create` two `models`: `Question` and
`Choice`.

A `Question` will `contain` a `question` and a `publication date`.

A `Choice` will `contain` two `fields`: a `text field` containing the `text` of
the `Choice`, `and` a vote score.

`Lastly`, each `Choice` is `associated` with a `Question`.

I `added` the `following` to `polls/models.py`:

```python
from django.db import models

# Create your models here.
class Question(models.Model):
  question_text = models.CharField(max_length=200)
  pub_date = models.DateTimeField("date published") # human readable name

class Choice(models.Model):
    question = models.ForeignKey(Question, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    choice_text = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    votes = models.IntegerField(default=0)
```

Each `model` is `represented by` a `class` that subclasses
`django.db.models.Model`.

Each `model` has a `number` of `class variables`, `each` of which `represents` a
`database field` in the `model`.

Each `field` is `represented` by an `instance` of a `Field class` – e.g.,
`CharField` for `character fields` and `DateTimeField` for `datetimes`. `This`
tells `Django` what `type` of `data` each `field` contains.

The `name` of each `Field` instance (e.g. `question_text` or `pub_date`) is the
`field`’s `name`, in `machine-friendly` format. We’ll `use` this `value` in our
`Python` code, `and` our `database` will `use` it `as` the `column name`.

`We` can `use` an optional `first` positional `argument` to a `Field` to
`designate` a `human-readable` name. That’s `used` in a `couple` of
`internal parts` of `Django`, and it `doubles` as `documentation`. `If` this
`field` isn’t `provided`, `Django` will `use` the `machine-readable` name.
`Here`, we’ve only `defined` a `human-readable` name for `Question.pub_date`.
For `all` other `fields` in this `model`, the `field`’s `machine-readable` name
is `used` as its `human-readable` name.

`Some` Field `classes` have `required arguments`. `CharField`, for example,
`requires` that we `pass` it a `max_length`. That’s `used` not `only` in the
`database schema`, `but` in `validation` as `well`.

A `Field` can also `have` optional `arguments`. `Here`, we `set` the
`default value` of `votes` to `0`.

`We` also `define` a `relationship` between `Choice` and `Question` using
`ForeignKey`. `That` tells `Django` each `Choice` is `related` to `a` single
`Question`. `Django` supports all `common` database `relationships`:
`many-to-one`, `many-to-many`, and `one-to-one`.

### Activating our models

`With` our `model` code `created`, `Django` can `do` the `following`:

1. `Create` a `database schema` (`CREATE TABLE` statements) `for` the `polls`
   app.
1. `Create` a `Python` database-access `API` for accessing `Question` and
   `Choice` objects.

But `first` we `need` to `tell` our `project` that the `polls` app is
`installed`. `How` do we `do that`? `By` adding `"polls"` to `INSTALLED_APPS`:

```python
# Application definition

INSTALLED_APPS = [
    "django.contrib.admin",
    "django.contrib.auth",
    "django.contrib.contenttypes",
    "django.contrib.sessions",
    "django.contrib.messages",
    "django.contrib.staticfiles",
    "polls", # new
]
```

`The` tutorial `states` that we `should` add
`"polls.apps.PollsConfig". `However`, `"polls"`is`fine`too.`That`is`how`I`do
it`.

`Now` Django `knows` to `include` the `polls` app.

`Next`, `we` can `run` the `following`:

```shell
python3 manage.py makemigrations polls
```

The `following` is `returned`:

```shell
Migrations for 'polls':
  polls/migrations/0001_initial.py
    + Create model Question
    + Create model Choice
```

`When` we run `makemigrations`, `we` are telling `Django` that `we've` made
`changes` to our `models`, `and` that we `want` to `store` the `changes` in a
`migration`.

`Migrations` are how `Django` stores `changes` to our `models` (and `thus` our
`database schema`). `They` are `"files on disk"`. That `means` they are `stored`
in our `project`'s `file system` instead `of` in a `database`.

`We` can `read` the `migration` for our `new model`, `which` is `represented` by
the `polls/migrations/0001_initial.py` file. It's `designed` to be
`human-editable` in `case` we `want` to manually `tweak` how `Django` changes
`things`.

`We` can `run` the `following command` to `see` what `SQL` that `migration`
would `run`:

```shell
python3 manage.py sqlmigrate polls 0001
```

This `returns` something `like` the `following`:

```shell
BEGIN;
--
-- Create model Question
--
CREATE TABLE "polls_question" ("id" integer NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, "question_text" varchar(200) NOT NULL, "pub_date" datetime NOT NULL);
--
-- Create model Choice
--
CREATE TABLE "polls_choice" ("id" integer NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, "choice_text" varchar(200) NOT NULL, "votes" integer NOT NULL, "question_id" bigint NOT NULL REFERENCES "polls_question" ("id") DEFERRABLE INITIALLY DEFERRED);
CREATE INDEX "polls_choice_question_id_c5b4b260" ON "polls_choice" ("question_id");
COMMIT;
```

`The` sqlmigrate `command` takes `migration names` and `returns` their `SQL`.

`The` exact `output` will `vary` depending `on` the `database` we `use`. The
`above` is `generated` for `PostgreSQL`.

1. `Table names` are `automatically generated` by `combining` the `name` of the
   `app` (`polls`) `and` the `lowercase name` of the `model` – `question` and
   `choice`. `We` can `override` this `behavior`.
1. `Primary keys` (`IDs`) are `added automatically`. `We` can `override` this,
   too.
1. `Django` appends `"_id"` to the `foreign key` field `name`. `We` can
   `override` this `too`.
1. The `foreign` key `relationship` is made `explicit` by a `FOREIGN KEY`
   constraint. We `don't` have to `worry about` the `DEFERRABLE` parts. It’s
   `telling` PostgreSQL to `not` enforce the `foreign key` until the `end` of
   the `transaction`.
1. The `code` is `specific` to the `database` we `use`, so `database-specific`
   field `types` such as `auto_increment` (`MySQL`), bigint
   `PRIMARY KEY GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY` (`PostgreSQL`), or `integer`
   primary key `autoincrement` (`SQLite`) are `handled` for us `automatically`.
   `Same` goes `for` the `quoting` of `field names` like using `double quotes`
   or `single quotes`.
1. `The` sqlmigrate `command` doesn’t actually `run` the `migration` on our
   `database`. `Instead`, it `prints it` to `Terminal` so `that` we can `see`
   what `SQL` Django `thinks` is `required`. It’s `useful` for `checking` what
   `Django` is `going` to `do` or `if` we have `database administrators` who
   require `SQL scripts` for `changes`.
1. `We` can `also` use `python3 manage.py check`. This `checks` for any
   `problems` in our `project` without making `migrations` or `touching` the
   `database`.

`When` I ran `python3 manage.py check`, I `got back` the `following` in
`Terminal`:

```shell
System check identified no issues (0 silenced).
```

`Then`, to `double check` that I `have` nothing to `migrate`, I `ran` the
`following command`:

```shell
python3 manage.py migrate polls
```

The `following` was `returned`:

```shell
Operations to perform:
  Apply all migrations: admin, auth, contenttypes, polls, sessions
Running migrations:
  Applying polls.0001_initial... OK
```

`I` had run `python3 manage.py makemigrations polls` beforehand, which `meant`
that I `had` to run `python3 manage.py migrate polls` after `that`. `As`
indicated `above`, `I` ran `migrate` again to `create` my `model` tables in my
`polls` database.

`The` migrate `command` takes `all` the `migrations` that `haven’t` been
`applied` (`Django` tracks `which ones` are `applied` using a `special table` in
our `database` called `django_migrations`) and `runs` them `against` our
`database`. `Basically`, `synchronizing` the `changes` we `made` to our `models`
with the `schema` in the `database`.

`Migrations` are very `powerful` and `let` us `change` our `models` over `time`,
as we `develop` our `project`, `without` the `need` to `delete` our `database`
or `tables` and `make` new `ones`. it `upgrades` our `database` in `realtime`,
`without` losing `data`.

`To recap`, the `following` is a `three-step` guide to `making changes` to our
`model`(s):

1. `Make changes` to our `models` in `models.py`
1. Run `python manage.py makemigrations` to create `migrations` for those
   `changes`
1. Run `python manage.py migrate` to `apply` those `changes` to the `database`.

The `reason` that `there` are `separate commands` to `make` and
`apply migrations` is `because` we’ll `commit migrations` to our
`version control system` (i.e., `Git`) `and` ship `them` with our `app`. They
not only `make` our `development` easier,`but`they’re also `usable` by
`other developers`and in `production`.

`For example`, in my `Django Boards` application, in my `build.sh` script for
`deployment` to `render.com`, I `add` the `following`:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env bash

set -o errexit  # exit on error

pip install -r requirements.txt

python manage.py collectstatic --no-input
python manage.py migrate
```

To `learn more` about `manage.py`, please visit
[django-admin and manage.py](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/ref/django-admin/)
in the `Django` documentation.

## Playing with the API in the interactive Python shell

To `start up` the `Python` shell, I `ran` the `following command`:

```shell
python3 manage.py shell
# which returns the following:
Python 3.13.0 (main, Nov 16 2024, 22:29:42) [Clang 16.0.0 (clang-1600.0.26.3)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
(InteractiveConsole)
>>>
```

We’re `using` this command `instead` of `“python”`, because `manage.py` sets the
`DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` environment `variable`, `which` gives `Django` the
`Python` import `path` to our `django_polls/settings.py` file.

`Later on`, I `will` be `reconfiguring` my `settings` to a `settings` directory
`instead` of `just` a `settings.py` file, `because` I `want` to `separate` my
`development` settings from my `production` settings.

`Once` I have `started up` the `shell`, `I` can `do` the `following` as `per`
the `tutorial`:

```shell
>>> from polls.models import Question, Choice
# No questions are in the system yet.
>>> Question.objects.all()
<QuerySet []>
# Create a new Question.
# Support for time zones is enabled in the default settings file, so
# Django expects a datetime with tzinfo for pub_date. Use timezone.now()
# instead of datetime.datetime.now() and it will do the right thing.
>>> from django.utils import timezone
>>> q = Question(question_text="What's going on?", pub_date=timezone.now())
# Save the object into the database. You have to call save() explicitly.
>>> q.save()
# Now it has an ID.
>>> q.id
>>> 1
>>> Question.objects.all()
>>> <QuerySet [<Question: Question object (1)>]>
# Access model field values via Python attributes.
>>> q.question_text
"What's going on?"
>>> q.pub_date
datetime.datetime(2025, 1, 5, 12, 57, 28, 254861, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc)
# Change values by changing the attributes, then calling save().
>>> q.question_text = "What's the problem?"
>>> q.save()
>>> q.question_text
"What's the problem?"
```

The `queeryset` representation `<QuerySet [<Question: Question object (1)>]>` of
`Question` is `not` very `human-readable`. `We` can `change` this by `adding`
the `following` in `polls/models.py`:

```python
from django.db import models

# Create your models here.
class Question(models.Model):
  question_text = models.CharField(max_length=200)
  pub_date = models.DateTimeField("date published") # human readable name

  def __str__(self): #new
     return self.question_text

class Choice(models.Model):
    question = models.ForeignKey(Question, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    choice_text = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    votes = models.IntegerField(default=0)

    def __str__(self): # new
       return self.choice_text
```

`It` is `important` to `add` the `__str__()` method `to` our `models` not only
`for` the `convenience` it `provides` in the `interactive shell`, but `also` in
the `admin interface`.

`Next`, I `add` a `custom method` to the `Question` model:

```python
from django.db import models
import datetime
from django.utils import timezone

# Create your models here.
class Question(models.Model):
  question_text = models.CharField(max_length=200)
  pub_date = models.DateTimeField("date published") # human readable name

  def recently_published(self): # new
     return self.pub_date >= timezone.now() - datetime.timedelta(days=1)

  def __str__(self):
     return self.question_text
```

To `learn more` about `timezone handling` in `Python`, please visit `Django`'s
[Time zones](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/topics/i18n/timezones/)
documentation.

`timezone.now()` is from `django.utils`, and it `provides` the `current time`
(`timezone-aware`) in a `particular timezone`.

`Django`'s `timezone.now()` not only `returns` the `date` and `time` of a
`particular timezone`, but `also` a `timezone-aware` datetime `object`. This
`means` it `also` contains `information` about the `timezone`.

`As` mentioned `earlier` in this `tutorial`, `If` we `haven't` explicitly `set`
a `different timezone` in our `Django` settings, `timezone.now()` will `return`
the `current time` in `UTC`. The `setting` I am `referring` to `is`:

```python
# settings.py
TIME_ZONE = "US/Eastern"
```

`Originally`, `it` was `set` to `"UTC"`, `but` I `changed it` to `"US/Eastern"`.

`datetime.timedelta()` is `part` of the `datetime` library. The
`datetime library` is usually `used` to calculate `differences` in `dates` and
for `date manipulations` in `Python`.

Syntax:

```python
datetime.timedelta(days=0, seconds=0, microseconds=0, milliseconds=0, minutes=0, hours=0, weeks=0)
# Returns Date
```

`In` my `case`, the `following` was `returned`:

## The Django admin

`According` to the `Django` documentation for `Django Polls part 2`,

> Generating admin sites for your staff or clients to add, change, and delete
> content is tedious work that doesn’t require much creativity. For that reason,
> Django entirely automates creation of admin interfaces for models.
>
> Django was written in a newsroom environment, with a very clear separation
> between “content publishers” and the “public” site. Site managers use the
> system to add news stories, events, sports scores, etc., and that content is
> displayed on the public site. Django solves the problem of creating a unified
> interface for site administrators to edit content.
>
> The admin isn’t intended to be used by site visitors. It’s for site managers.

### Creating the superuser

We `need` to `create` a `superuser` who can `access` the `admin interface`.
`In order` to do `that`, we `run` the `following command` in `Terminal`:

```shell
python3 manage.py createsuperuser
```

`Follow` the `prompts` for `creating` the `superuser`, `and` something `like`
the `following` will `appear` when the `superuser` has `been` successfully
`created`:

```shell
Superuser created successfully.
```

`For now`, `you` can `skip` the email `part`.

## Starting the development server

`Next`, I `started` the `development server` by `running` the following
`command` in `Terminal`:

```shell
python3 manage.py runserver
```

`When` I `go` to `admin/`, the `following appears`:

![The admin login page](Screenshot-2025-01-05-at-3.34.44-PM.jpg)

_The admin login page_

I `uses` the `credentials` I `used` to `create` my `superuser`, `and` it `got`
me `into` the `admin interface`. `All` I could `see` at the `moment` was the
`following`:

![Landing on the admin interface for the first time](Screenshot-2025-01-05-at-3.39.31-PM.jpg)

_Landing on the admin interface for the first time_

`There were` only `Users` and `Groups`, no `Groups`, and `only` one `user`. The
`superuser` we `created` to `get into` the `admin interface`.

The `Users` and `Groups` are `provided` by the `django-contrib-auth`, `Django`'s
authentication `framework`.

### Making the poll app modifiable in the admin

`You` will `notice` that `when` we `entered` the `admin interface`, `we` didn't
`see` our `polls` app `anywhere`. That's `because` we didn't `register` it `yet`
in `polls/admin.py`. `To` make it `visible` in the `admin interface` so `I`
could `edit` it, I `added` the `following` to `polls/admin.py`:

```python
# polls/admin.py
from django-contrib import admin

from .models import Question
admin.site.register(Question)
```

When `I` registered `Question`, `I` could `see` the `following` in the
`admin interface`:

![Appearance of Polls app Question](Screenshot-2025-01-05-at-3.50.02-PM.jpg)

_Appearance of Polls app Question_

`When` I `clicked` on `Questions`, I `saw` the `following`:

![Clicking on Questions](Screenshot-2025-01-05-at-3.55.31-PM.jpg)

_Clicking on Questions_

`When` I `clicked` on `"What's the problem?"`, `the` following `appeared`:

![Result of clicking on "What's the problem?"](Screenshot-2025-01-05-at-3.58.12-PM.jpg)

_Result of clicking on "What's the problem?"_

`Now` I `could` edit `"What's the problem?"`.

### Some things to know about the Question form

1. The `form` is automatically `generated` from the `Question` model.
1. The `different` model `field types` (`DateTimeField`, `CharField`)
   `correspond to` the appropriate `HTML` input `widget`. `Each type` of `field`
   knows `how` to display `itself` in the `Django` admin.
1. `Each DateTimeField` gets `free` JavaScript `shortcuts`. `Dates` get a
   `“Today” shortcut` and `calendar popup`, and `times` get a `“Now” shortcut`
   and a `convenient popup` that `lists` commonly entered `times`.

`We` are `given` a few `options` to choose `from` at the `bottom` of the `page`:

1. `Save` saves `changes` and `returns` to the `change-list` page `for` this
   `type` of `object`.
1. `Save and add another` – saves `changes` and `loads` a `new`, blank `form`
   for this `type` of `object`.
1. `Save and continue editing` saves `changes` and `reloads` the `admin` page
   `for` this `object`.
1. `Delete` displays a `delete` confirmation `page`.

`If` the `value` of `Date/Time Published` isn't the `same` as the `time` I
`created` the `question` in `Tutorial 1`, `it` probably `means` I `forgot` to
`set` the `correct value` for the `TIME_ZONE` setting. `I` could `change` it,
`reload` the `page` and `make sure` the `correct` value `appears`. `But` in my
`case`, `it` was `correct`.

`Next`, `we` can `change` the `"Date published"` by clicking `"Today"` and
`"Now"` shortcuts. `Then` we click `"Save and continue editing"`. `Then`, to
`see` all the `changes` we have `made` to this `entry`, we `click` on
`"History"`. `We` are `taken` to a `page` listing `all` the `changes` made `to`
the `entry`. It `states` the `date` and `time` the `change` was `made`, `who`
made `it`, `and` the `action` taken.

## Conclusion

In this section, I `set up` the `Django Polls` database, explained/set
`LANGUAGE_CODE`,` USE_I18N`, `USE_THOUSAND_SEPARATOR`, `NUMBER_GROUPING`,
`USE_TZ`, and `INSTALLED_APPS`, `created` the `polls` models, `activated` the
`models`, `played with` the `API` in the `interactive` Python `shell`,
`discussed` the `Django` admin `interface`, `created` a `superuser`, `started`
the `development server`, `registered` polls `app` in `polls/admin.py`, and
`discussed` the `Question` form in the `admin interface`.
