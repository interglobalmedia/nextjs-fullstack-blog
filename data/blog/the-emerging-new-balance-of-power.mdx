`Russia` has **_invaded_** `Ukraine`. While **_all_** the **_attention_** is
**_focused there_**, `China` is **_closing in_** on `Taiwan`. This is **_nothing new_**, but `Russia`'s **_move_** will probably **_embolden_** `China` to **_do more_** than **_just that_**. The **_global_** `balance of power` is **_shifting_**. Even **_more reason_** to **_become truly_**
`technologically aware`.

In `developer circles`, we are **_already_** talking about Web3 taking over
Web2. **_Yes_**, `Web2` does **_not_** address **_all_** the **_issues_** and or **_threats_** that `currently face` **_all_** of **_us_**. **_Especially_** new ones that **_have developed_** in **_recent days_**.

**_According_** to [techcabal.com](https://techcabal.com/2022/01/18/what-exactly-is-web3/),

> To explain it in one word, Web3 is all about decentralization—from platforms
Meta, Alphabet (Google), and Amazon; governments; and the traditional
financial system. By placing power in the hands of individuals instead, Web3
promises to deepen the democratization of the internet.

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web3),

> Web3 (also known as Web 3.0 and sometimes stylized as web3) is an idea for a
new iteration of the World Wide Web based on blockchain technology, which
incorporates concepts including decentralization and token-based economics.
Some technologists and journalists have contrasted it with Web 2.0, wherein
they say data and content are centralized in a small group of companies
sometimes referred to as "Big Tech". The term was coined in 2014 by Ethereum
co-founder Gavin Wood, and the idea gained interest in 2021 from
cryptocurrency enthusiasts, large technology companies, and venture capital
firms.

**_According_** to [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2022/01/24/what-is-web3-all-about-an-easy-explanation-with-examples/),

> Web3 is currently a work-in-progress and isn’t exactly defined yet. However,
the main principle is that it will be decentralized – rather than controlled
by governments and corporations, as is the case with today’s internet – and,
to some extent, connected to the concept of the “metaverse."
>
> Before we start – just to avoid confusion – it’s worth mentioning that, until a few years ago, the term “web 3.0” was frequently used to describe what is now known as the “semantic web." This was a concept put forward by the
original "father of the internet," Sir Tim Berners-Lee, for a
machine-to-machine internet. Language is defined by its use, and the term is
more frequently used to describe something else now. However, Berners-Lee’s
concepts are considered to be a part of what we now call web3, although not
the entirety of it.

To **_learn more_**, please **_visit_** the **_article_** entitled
`What Is Web3 All About? An Easy Explanation With Examples` by `Bernard Marr` on [forbes.com](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2022/01/24/what-is-web3-all-about-an-easy-explanation-with-examples/).

We **_might see_** a much more **_accelerated shift_** to Web3 than **_anyone_** even **_dreamed of_** namely **_due_** to **_recent developments_** in `Ukraine` AND `Taiwan`. **_However_**, there are **_so many_** `non-technologists` who do **_don't_** even **_know_** what `Web2` is all about.

**_Traditionally_**, `developers` (**_and_** `others`) would **_state_**
something like

> There is no reason for everyone to know about the web! Leave it to us to deal with for them.

**_No_**. With the **_advent_** of `"smart technology"`, **_everyone_** should
have **_had_** at **_least_** a `basic understanding` of **_what_** the `Web` is **_all about_** and **_what_** is **_goes on_** there. `Web2` and
**_eventually_** (or **_not_** so **_eventually_**) Web3 **_should_** be
**_taught_** in `schools` (**_especially_** in `higher education`) as **_part_** of the `core curriculum`. We talk about **_pushing_** for `women` and `girls` to **_enter_** `STEM`. Let's take it a **_step further_**. Let's **_educate_** the **_"entire population"_** about **_current_** AND **_future technologies_**. They **_don't_** have to **_become_** `developers`, `data scientists`, `software engineers`, `cyber-security professionals`, etc. They **_just_** have to be **_made aware_** of the `concepts`, `issues` and `threats` which **_exist_**.

**_Yes_**. `"Lock up your digital world".` Maybe **_now_** (**_some_** of my)
`lecture(s)` to my `students` will `"hold more weight"` and `"make more sense"` **_because_** of **_everything_** that is **_going on_** right now. Just as with `COVID-19`, when it **_struck_** the **_world_**, **_sometimes_** it **_takes_** a `crisis/disaster` for **_something_** to `"click"` and for the **_world_** to `"wake up"`. But it **_should be_** the **_other way around_**. This is **_where_** #chaosengineering should come in! The **_principles_** of `#chaosengineering` **_should become_** a **_default_**.

It's **_not just_** `about developers` or **_other_** `technologists`
**_being_** the **_ones_** who **_know_** what the `Web` is **_all about_** and what **_goes on_** there. **_Everyone_** should have at LEAST a BASIC
`understanding` so that they can **_protect themselves_**. So that they
**_know_** what to **_watch out for_**. I am **_not_** the **_only one_** of
**_this opinion_**, and NOW it is **_more crucial_** than **_ever_**.

Just **_listen_** to what is `being said` **_today_** on the **_news_**. It's
**_no joke_**. `People`, **_educate yourselves_**. `Educational institutions`,
**_educate_** the **_population_**. The `time` is **_NOW_**.

**_Don't_** `give up your power` to **_someone else_** because of a **_lack_**
of **_knowledge_** or **_awareness_**. **_Give_** it **_back_** to
**_yourself_** through **_knowledge_**. `Knowledge` **_IS_** `power`!
